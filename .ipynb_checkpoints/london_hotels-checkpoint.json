Whilst other users have expressed dissatisfaction with the Tower Thistle on this website I had always received a reasonably good experience - until this weekend.  I checked  in on Sunday afternoon - for \u00a3168 I received a \"standard single room\".  I was offered an Executive room for an additional \u00a330 but I declined.  Breafast was not included. For my \u00a3168 I had a room over the airconditioning machines.  I turned on the tv and but the remote control did not work.  A new remote control was ordered which worked for the evening. This broke the next day. (Two days, three remote controls).  The first evening I had dinner in their carvery restaurant.  The sign on the outside mentioned \"Early", " bird - leave by 7\", cost of c.\u00a315.  When I received the bill it was for \u00a322.  The waitress advised that the early bird tariff only applied on Monday-Saturday.  I paid as I could not remember the wording outside the restaurant.  However, I was right.  I drew the manager's attention to this, who said that someone had put the wrong menu on display and the cost was \u00a322. At no stage was there an apology. So in summary, expensive room, poor view, old remote controls and a restaurant manager who could not care less.  But, I have not even mentioned my favourite incident.  When the service guy came to repair the remote control I pointed out the state of the headboard which was covered in stains.  His attempt to put my mind at rest involved stressing that the stains were old and not new.  Phew what a relief!?!. Many people stay at the hotel to be near the Tower of London - my advice is to stay at the Tower of London, at least the staff are pleasant. ", "\u2026", "Booked our hotel through a travel agent.  Excellent location, right by the Tower of London and London Bridge.  Took a launch from Tower Pier to the O2.  Room fine, beds OK, a little narrow.  Breakfast fine.  Concierege service excellent.  Would definately recommend and use again.", "I am responsible for offering travel advice to my staff. We're a transportation company so there is extensive worldwide travel involved for most members of our staff. I have advised our company travel agent that under no circumstances is she to book anyone into this hotel.I often go to London for extended business trips (often 2 to 4 weeks at a time). I usually stay at a small company preferred hotel near the Tower Bridge, but decided to try the Tower Thistle for a change.I was there for 2 weeks. During my stay there, the fire alarm went off 9 times and the entire hotel had to be evacuated each time. No explanations were provided, no evacuation guidance was offered and no apologies were given. One time, the alarm went off before 6 am on a very cold and rainy Sunday morning.I had", " a beautiful City View room but it was extremely cold (in the middle of winter in 2002). I called to have the thermostat adjusted several times, but to no avail. All they could give me was an electric heater which broke on the first night. I complained very loudly and was moved to another room 4 days later. The new room was nice, but extremely noisy (it overlooked a construction site).I understand that no hotel room can be perfect, but the staff simply would not listen to my concerns or simply trivialized them.", "\u2026", "I have just returned this morning from a two night stay at the Thistle Tower, and i must say that, having stayed in mid- and high-class hotels around the world, this is truly the worst hotel service i have ever experienced.  The hotel itself (i.e. the building and the location, as well as the general decor etc.) is definately inkeeping with 4-star quality, however, the service and food is simply abysmal.  This pretty much sums up what i thought of the hotel, so for those who simply want a quick synopsis you can stop here; for those who want more, i have posted our full experience below.  I was lucky enough to be able to combine a short business trip with a sightseeing trip for myself and my fiancee, and chose the Tower Thistle, since it was close to both the Docklands office", " where i had a meeting, and the major tourist attractions. We drove from the ferry terminal at Liverpool (approx. 5 hour drive) and parked in the hotel car park.  - Check-in was an absolute nightmare. We ended up standing in the foyer for over an hour (after a 5 hour drive and a ferry journey) waiting while they attempted to check us in, because they had \"no record of our booking\", after having booked on Expedia. At no point did they offer us any assistance, or even somewhere to sit down - they simply told us that we would need to pay \u00a312 for internet access in order to contact Expedia and sort the problem out ourselves. We were finally able to get Expedia to contact them, after which they were able to check us in.  - After the shambles at check-in, i paid \u00a335 per night for an upgrade to an \"executive room\" - the room itself was pretty good, with a nice view of Tower Bridge, though i have seen a lot of bigger and better equipped rooms at the same price and star level. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the mini-bar was not stocked or switched on. The in-room high-speed internet access worked well, and was pretty speedy, though quite expensive (\u00a315 per day - many hotels now offer it at no extra cost). We didn't notice any of the staining problems mentioned by other reviewers, were put on a non-smoking floor, as requested, and the bathroom was clean (this may have been because we upgraded our room, however).  - The next problem came when we ordered room service. We ordered what we thought to be a very simple order of a plate of dressed nachos and a Coke. When it came, however, there was no Coke and the nachos were plain apart from a very liberal helping of cheese.  - We went shopping and sight-seeing the next day, after a good night of sleep (the hotel is fairly quiet) and a mediocre buffet breakfast, but when we returned dying for a bath after being on our feet all day, we could not get into our room. I thought that perhaps my wallet had somehow wiped my keycard, so i tried my fiancee's - no luck there either. So i left my fiancee standing outside the room and went back down eight floors to reception, to find, after a 15 minute wait to be served, that our keycards had \"expired\" and would need to be reprogrammed. I handed over both keycards to be reprogrammed, and they were both handed back, with a promise that they would now be valid \"for two weeks\" even though i was checking out the next day, which made me quite uneasy about how many other people might have a key to that would open my room. When i got back to the room only one worked.  - The next problem came the following morning, when i received a wake up call at 9am, that i most certainly had not ordered (intending to have a lie in before the drive home). Reception had no idea why we were given a wakeup call.  - Since we were awake anyway, we thought we might as well take advantage of the buffet breakfast - we headed down to the carvery, where we had breakfast the previous morning. On arriving, at 9:45, the restaurant manager greeted us by saying \"breakfast is finished, you will have to go elsewhere\" and proceeded to walk away before we could even question why breakfast was finished before 10am, which is the published finishing time. He is easily one of the rudest hotel employees i have ever had the displeasure of meeting.  - After a thirty minute queue, we eventually got checked out, and not a moment too soon. As we were checking out, it was evident we were not the only displeased customers - an American gentleman standing next to me was demanding his money back.  Hope this is of use to anyone considering the Thistle Tower!

Truly not recommended especially because of the rude staff. I truly don't understand how they alow a business like this to be aloud to run. There is no point in trying to get a refund as if the staff cannot deal with you on phone and slam it down. How will I be able to get a refund.

I am happy to pay top prices for a small glass of exceptional fine wine, but not for a less than average glass of plonk.  That was my first mistake, my second was asking to see the duty manager. After a long wait he arrived and I explained why I was not happy with the lack of information available in the bar. I don't think I have ever met someone in the services industry less suited to the task than him.  He had no sympathy for the situation, expressed none, and tried to dismiss it with total disdain. He was thankfully displeased when I 'dismissed' him from the table, as is typical with people like that he is better at giving out indifference than receiving it.  I can only assume that the general manager does not encourage this kind of low grade attitude towards guests, there was certainly no other evidence of this in any other member of staff, so he must be a character who keeps under the radar when the director is around but probably is disliked by staff.

I don't understand the bad reviews. I chose this place a little tentatively because of the comments.  After a two week stay I was able to see many details of the place.  I've stayed in about 18-20 hotels in London, some very posh ones. But the maid service here I found amazing.  Working from very early to very late.  I've had my room cleaned at different times from 10am to 3:00pm.  At most places they pass by and if they skipped you you have to call to get service. I noticed the whole coordination and was amazed. However I do believe the experience may vary floor to floor because I noticed that some maintenance details change by floor.  On 5 the lighting is white and it's very clear which way to go.  On 7th it's yellow light and", " directions are not so easy to follow. The room: it's clean, it's feels new (as in its not a tired hotel) - fresh paint, no chipped edges on walls, no mould in corners etc.   After reviews I asked for an inside room and it wasn't noisy at all. Some nights I slept with the window open. (Weird wood format but it blocks light out completely.) My room was tiny the bathroom was pretty good. Amenities: one fan, one kettle, hairdryer and safe. I was able to plug my phone, the fan, my laptop at different outlets. Reading light was perfect. And yes the room, at least mine was ridiculously small.  But I've been on other hotels in London that are almost the same size but worse location and more expensive. The rest of the hotel.... Weird lobby. You have to go up steps once inside so you can't roll in with your bags.  Lobby is ok for waiting. Lots of waiting space. Check in is located in a weird area around the back.  Concierge has a better location. The internet was perfect in lobby. Iffy in my room.   Breakfast is good. Selection of breads, hot and cold stuff.  I did get tired of the same after 4rth day.

They didn't have a front desk, so after calling several times, they finally took us to the property we would be staying at without even letting us know beforehand where we would be. We got an incredibly hot room in an awful smelling building with dirty floors and a disgusting bathroom. Our friends who also booked a room let the office know that they'd be checking in late and yet still didn't answer for us to get their keys for the room they would be staying in. We ended up leaving before the first night was done and checking in at a different hotel. Never EVER book here, it was the worst. Too much money for an awful place.", "My partner and I booked a long-term studio, not because it was particularly cheap (1100 quid per month), but because it was convenient. We were just moving to London from Spain and it was one of the only places we found we could book something long-term online.  Well then. First of all, I was informed I would be charged an extra fee for late check-in (at 6pm, but oh well) and another extra fee for it being Saturday - fair enough. The place is in a nice-enough area in North West London. However, it's not five minutes away from Willesden Green tube station as they claim, but rather fifteen/twenty minutes away. When I finally reached the place (my partner was joining me the following week so I was alone), there was no one there waiting for me. I had told them I would be arriving at", " that hour of that day, but still. No one. I called the office - there was no one there. I was stood up, with my suitcases, and no one was picking up the phone.   I spent the night at a hotel.  I called the following day and they were all \"oh, but you should've been given the caretaker's mobile phone, he would've come open the door for you\". Yes, well, when I made the booking no one gave me the 'caretaker's' phone. To show their good faith, they didn't charge me the extra fee for late booking (as if), but they did charge me the extra fee for it being Sunday.   The place was what I was expecting. Small, relatively clean (relatively!!!), with a mattress that was thirty years old (I checked the label, it was from the late seventies). The bathroom was fine, so was the kitchen, even if the oven was filthy and so was the fridge.   My partner arrived a week later and we asked for another set of keys to be provided. They said 'yes', but days went by and no one came over. We called, they said 'yes, we'll bring it over', but still nothing. We called three times, the last time we weren't very nice, and in the end - about a month later - we got the keys.   Now let me tell you about some of the wonders of the place. There are at least forty people sharing quarters in that house and there is only one washing machine and one tumble drier. The washing machine is insanely expensive (almost three pounds per wash) and it only accepts one pound and twenty pence coins. The tumble drier wasn't working when we arrived and didn't work in the six months we spent there, but oh well. At some point in winter, the washing machine got flooded and became a swimming pool for mosquitos and other insects. Charming.   The maintenance team was also amazing. In September, the heating couldn't be turned off, up to a point where we were sleeping in our underwear because it was stifling. It took them almost three weeks to come have a look, and then they didn't fix it - they broke it. When it began getting colder and we tried to turn it on again, it didn't work. I think that time it took them around two weeks to come over.   The heating stopped working at least three times in the six months we spent there, and in two occasions it wasn't our heater - it was the boiler. This means that no one in that house had any heating whatsoever. I hope you like snuggling, because it gets as cold as the North Pole in there.   When it comes to paying the rent, you have to pay in cash at the end of the month. And you have to be there in person - if you can't be there because you're working or studying, there are extra fees to be paid (HA). If you don't let them know, they just assume you're not paying that month and they charge you - guess what? - another extra fee!  And it's not like they come at 8pm when almost everyone can be home, no, no. They come at 10am on a Tuesday when everybody is away.   And finally, the cherry on top of the cake. The day we left (finally, after six bleak months!), I was told I would be charged - yes - an extra fee because it was Saturday again. I was also very adamantly told that I needed to be out of the room at 10am to return the keys, or else I'd be charged. At 10am I was outside the room, keys in hand, and there was no one there. 10:15, 10:30... the taxi waiting for me... I had to call them, and they were cheeky enough to sound surprised that I was waiting. I almost threw the keys at them, I was livid.   So, all in all - don't go there. Even if you're desperate, don't. Find somewhere else. We are currently living in a much bigger flat and paying less than what we paid there, and it is a much better, livelier zone.   P.S: Oh, they boast 'wifi included', but the wifi is next to non-existent. We had to buy a mobile internet device because we couldn't even use Skype.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "68", "attractions_nearby": "8", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "60", "top_cuisines": ["Italian", "Italian", "Italian", "British"]},

They had been switched off so the apartment was quite cold on the first night.  I did, however, work out that turning one of the cooker rings on took the edge off.  After that, it was lovely and cosy.  Also, the toaster kept tripping the RCD.  Not their fault, just something that happens.

My whole experience was delightful, from our warm welcome (despite the fact we arrived in the evening, 6 hours late. thanks Vigin!) to our equally late departure, (we were not hurried out, and were able to leave our bags, and retain our key so that we could make the most of our day in town) I  do agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers that TIti the adorable housekeeper, and Gail, the owner, were hospitable in the extreme, and that the enormous affectionate cat made us feel right at home... but I must say that I do NOT  think \u00a37.50 for a full english breakfast hand-cooked to order is a lot!

I was warmly greeted and shuffled in from the freezing cold. Gail Downey was so especially thoughtfull and...i was quite charmed/  This is a little oasis which I hadn t expected to find near Marylebone.  So much better than staying at yet another hotel as i have got so used to the unpersonal nature of Hotel life.  The bedroom s were charmingly decorated and incredibly homely.

I shall definitely be going back and just hope this review doesn t make too many people stay there so that i ll still be able to get a booking.  Sheree Mcmurray", "\u2026", "I was first recommended Weardowney through some friends from Barcelona who had stayed there on their honeymoon last year.  As I  travel to London on a regular basis for work, I was looking for somewhere I would feel good returning too.  Ive stayed in many small hotels, from the Travel Lodge, to family run b and b's and guesthouses. A friend of mine was surfing yesterday and found a recent review on Tripadvisor that he told me about. Weardowney most certainly doesn't strike me as a dump!! It is quite the opposite! In all honesty I would give Weardowney 5 stars on all fronts.  From the warm welcome upon my first arrival, to the attention shown me to my requests (i was on some medication that needed to be kept at a certain temperature, and was on a special diet which mean't they", " altered their menu for me) nothing was too much trouble.  The victorian building was originally a pub and the old bar area is Weardowneys boutique and knitting school.  There's much more to this place than the average guesthouse  and the benefit of a shared kitchen is a joy as I can pop down whenever I choose and help myself, or be catered for. In July on one of my stays, I got a room next to the roof terrace and really felt I'd got my own place as I sat and worked away whilst enjoying my lunch in the sunshine.  I must say I'm quite amazed at the review that my friend brought to my attention, and feel qualified to disagree.  Having stayed in 3 of the bedrooms (out of the 6 rooms) I've not experienced any 'leaky plumbing' nor 'rough towels' or 'paper-thin walls'.  To criticize a dining room for being 'windowless' seems a little absurd!  Moreover, to state that their is no place to 'gather' is completely untrue. The boutique and school area is welcoming, and coffee and tea are available all day. I often use it in the evenings to relax in for an hour or two after my day, and have had many pleasureable chats with other guests and visitors.  I can't think of anything to complain about at the House of Weardowney, at all, actually -except perhaps that too many guests seem to feel the same about it and I worry that one day I may not be able to book in!", "\u2026", "Perhaps there are no bargains in London. This certainly is not one.  Although the price was right, it was still over $130 per night. And although other reviews spoke of this as a place where 'models, photographers and fashionistas gather,' whoever wrote those must be delusional. For one thing, there's no place whatsoever to gather at House of Weardowney. Only a little shop (of their fashion line) on the main floor, with no place to sit. Everything speaks of neglect  - from the dirty carpeting to the stained walls, leaky plumbing, used soap, rough towels, mattresses with springs that meet your back, no place to hang clothes, paper-thin walls which transmit noises from other rooms (especially annoying when your neighbors return at 3:00 AM)- this is not a place to find comfort.", " Breakfast is served in a windowless basement at one small table. Although the proprietors and Indonesian housekeeper are lovely, nobody is maintaining this place well, if at all.

I truly felt like I owned the piece of land of Monopoly - it is definitely a feel good place.

In addition to this, the owners of the apartment obviously picked up a brilliant bargain on the brown parcel tape as they also decided to use it on the bottom of the stairs in the apartment. However we were in Mayfair so what do you expect?  When heading out we were greeted by another staff member in Barry, unfortunately Barry wasn\u2019t as warm and welcoming as Paul - he was just on his phone every time we saw him.  One disappointing thing with the property was that the men (Barry and Paul) who owned the property loved getting out their card machine out at every opportunity with prices fluctuating by the second.

We knew at the time of booking that we would have to collect the keys for this apartment from Camden Town.  On arrival at the booking office we were greeted with no eye contact or smiles or even hellos!  Eventually someone acknowledged our existance and we received our details.  My husband pointed out that the street on which we were staying was not where we orginally booked.  The agent immediately went on the defensive, staying that Booking.com were agents in the area and we would be placed in a room that was as advertised to the same standards...  We then went off for another tube journey to arrive at our destination.  The website comments showed customers staying that there was a lift to help them with their heavy baggage, but we were treated to at least six", " flights of steep stairs (no lift), they looked like they had not seen a vacuum for a long time and they appeared to be covered in dog hairs!  One thing I did not notice, but was picked up by my husband, there were a number of mouse traps on the stairs too.  After unlocking the door we went into the tinest place we have ever stayed in.  The leather sofa as advertised turned out to be a dirty looking uncomfortable orange fabric thing, other than the kitchen the furniture looked like it was the cheapest possible found.  The flat was cold, so we followed the instructions and went out for a drink whilst it warmed up.  On returning to the flat we found that it was even colder and we no longer had hot water too.  We immediately rang the number which was stuck on the back of the door for the agents - no reply.  We rang another agent who asked us if we would be able to manage without heating or hot water until the morning, we had business meetings so this was out of the question.  We then rang Booking.com, in America - who said she had contacted a local agent who would ring us back within 10 minutes.  The call never came, by this time my husband had booked us into a different hotel.  So we unplugged our laptop (which by the way we had to plug into a bedroom socket, as the lounge area socket had 8 plugs running off just one extension lead, with other extension leads plugged into that - a potential fire hazard??) and left the building as by this time it was almost 11pm.  As we were settling down in our new hotel we rang the agents and told them what we had done.

The rooms are self-contained apartments with comfortable, basic facilities. Every room has an ensuite bathroom, bed and access to a kitchen (regular rooms share a kitchen, suites have a kitchenette but the kitchen facilities - pots, utensils etc - are limited). The rooms do not have a television, hairdryer or kettle but there are social areas with TVs and lounge facilities. The Hashtag staff are available from the morning until early evening to help check-in/out and look after luggage (for an additional cost), after which the on-site security keep watch over the building.   When I visited, I stayed in one of the suite rooms which contained a double bed,", " desk, wardrobe, kitchenette and bathroom. The kitchen consisted of a sink, fridge, freezer, microwave, hob and cupboards, with two sets of plates, bowls, side plates, cups, glasses and cutlery. There is a small pan but no cooking implements. You're left two sets of towels, shampoo and shower gel. This is not a hotel room and as such does not get cleaned and replenished daily, but I believe it does after a certain number of days for an extended stay.  I stayed with Hashtag Shepherd's Bush for a couple of days in August, shortly after they had set up. The staff seemed to still be getting to grips with running it, but it was mostly a smooth experience. I arrived before check-in was open and paid \u00a35 for my bags to be stored, and when I returned later on there was some confusion between the staff when retrieving them. This was only a minor issue, and before long I was checked in, issued a room key and given access to the wifi. The key fob gives key-less access after hours to the building and opens the doors to the landing and room. The main area just past check-in consists of several lounge spaces and a games area with a pool table and vending machines, which are all available to guests.  The room itself was perfect for my short stay, with every basic facility and some extras to make it a convenient visit. My biggest problem in terms of facilities was the lack of kettle, which would have been a nice addition. The room was large, clean and had ample storage areas. Unfortunately, as it was the height of summer, it was also swelteringly hot! The window only opens a little way and as this was one of the hottest weekends of the year, it was hotter inside the room than outside.   Aside from the heat, I couldn't really fault Hashtag Shepherd's Bush. The staff may have been getting to grips with the system, but they were all very friendly, helpful and resolved any issues that came about. The rooms and facilities were excellent for the price, and (aside from the temperature) everything was very comfortable and pleasant. You would struggle to stay in London at even the most dingy facility for \u00a360 a night (believe me; I've stayed in my share of horrible hotels!) so this was a very reasonably priced and comfortable alternative.

It might be fixed by now, but it was always easier to just walk down the stairs than wait for the elevator.  It's pretty conveniently located and a short walk away to either Barbican Station or Liverpool Street Station.  I recommend that if you're arriving, you should go to Liverpool Street Station since walking on the road underneath the Barbican facilities can be quite intimidating.  Also, there are stairs at Barbican Station - whilst there are escalators at LSS.  If you're coming from Stanstead Airport on the train, you can walk off the Express and cross over a few blocks easily to Sundial Court.  There are two pubs facing Sundial Court, but the establishments in the area get most of their business during the week from the workers in the office buildings, so the area can be rather dead on weekends.  A Waitrose Supermarket is just around the corner (behind Sundial Court) so that's a good place to buy food to eat (as well as bottles of cheap vodka).

Nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 l'hotel 65 le 30/12/06 en milieu de journ\u00e9e. Le directeur nous a gentiment accueillis et nous a pr\u00e9venu qu'il attendait 80 personnes le soir m\u00eame. Il nous a alors propos\u00e9 d'aller dans l'un de ses 6 autres h\u00f4tels (il en poss\u00e8de 7 en tout, relativement petits chacun) : le Springfield Hotel situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la station Lancaster Gate (sur la ligne rouge). Nous avons accept\u00e9 sa proposition puisqu'il nous a indiqu\u00e9 que cet h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait plus proche du centre de Londres (cela \u00e9tait donc plus pratique pour nos visites !). De plus, il \u00e9tait r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 comme un 3 *** (l'Hotel 65 \u00e9tait un 2 **).  Nous nous sommes donc dirig\u00e9s vers cet h\u00f4tel, o\u00f9 malheureusement, une", " chambre de bonne avec 2 lits simples nous attendait en sous-sol, juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la salle de restauration. Ayant pay\u00e9 pour une chambre double (et non pas pour cette chambre ridiculement petite et d\u00e9labr\u00e9e : la 1A pour \u00eatre pr\u00e9cise), nous sommes retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accueil de l'h\u00f4tel pour faire part de notre m\u00e9contentement et afin que changer de chambre ! Il n'y en avait pas d'autre de disponible dans cet h\u00f4tel !  Nous sommes donc retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'Hotel de d\u00e9part, l'Hotel 65 qui nous a cette fois envoy\u00e9 dans l'Hotel New Century Inn (situ\u00e9 juste en face, sur l'autre trottoir). Ayant perdu toute notre apr\u00e8s-midi dans ces d\u00e9placements d'h\u00f4tels en h\u00f4tels (avec nos bagages et sous la pluie) en marchant et en prenant les transports (Ligne rouge : Central Line), nous avons exig\u00e9 une compensation au niveau de notre petit d\u00e9jeuner ! Nous avons r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un full english breakfast au lieu du simple petit d\u00e9jeuner continental (toasts, jus d'orange et boisson chaude). Le directeur a eu du mal \u00e0 accepter, mais nous a offert l'english breakfast, pour le 1er matin seulement\u2026 pour nous d\u00e9dommager de notre apr\u00e8s-midi perdue.  Points positifs de l'h\u00f4tel (New Century Inn, chambre 8) : chambre nettoy\u00e9e chaque jour (poubelles vid\u00e9es, serviettes chang\u00e9es, lit fait), petit d\u00e9jeuner correct.  Points n\u00e9gatifs de l'h\u00f4tel (New Century Inn, chambre 8) : tr\u00e8s bruyant (les voitures passent juste en dessous la fen\u00eatre, et ce, toute la nuit), pas de volets, SDB et chambre petites, cloison tr\u00e8s fine avec la chambre voisine (\u2026), t\u00e9l\u00e9 c\u00e2bl\u00e9e avec... seulement 4 cha\u00eenes !

Overall a fine experience. It was our fault for leaving it so late. Minor details and a major cleaning lapse let it down.   I recommend taking small amounts of cleaning products (mainly soap) to save buying them and we took our own towels which was a good idea as theirs were the usual one small towel each.

The stairs up to the apartment were very small and the musty, dirty smell was overwhelming. 3.The apartment advertised that it could sleep up to 3 people, and we had booked for 3 people, yet the only bed was that small that you could not even call it a double. When we mentioned that we needed", " another bed we were hand a rolled up bunch of linen and told to turn the so called sofa into the third bed. The linen was not folded, ironed or fresh, as a matter of fact it was dirty. 4. Speaking of dirty, the whole apartment on close inspection was filthy. The bins were full of rubbish, the floors had not been swept or mopped for some considerable time and the bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned! 5. We only had towels for two people and asked for extra. We were told that they would be brought up shortly but we never did see the extra towels. As a matter of fact we never saw anyone again!  6. We were told that the WiFi was very good and that we will have no problems but the Wifi just kept dropping out and was impossible to use. 7. The only furniture in the whole apartment was the miniature bed, the so called sofa and a coffee table. No bed side tables, no chairs, nothing else. Oh, yes there was a Television.

They are not even supposed to rent to non university affiliated people- but they do (construction workers, teenagers, vacationers are all people I met while staying there). If you are loud at night do not stay here- you will have masters and Ph.D. students yelling at you.  The building is old and falling apart.  \"Newly renovated\" translates into a decade ago (we think- we got different dates from different staff)- carpets are fraying, plumbing floods into the halls and rooms regularly, tiles are broken and lose, fire alarms go off constantly (hairspray and 5 minutes of a blow dryer on high will set it off) and are tested once a week, and a few rooms have so much mold they", " offer money back to people who have been placed there.  The location is of course great and for poor student housing it is good so long as you don't mind mold, rodents, and a building that's seen better days (we had water running down walls from bad plumbing- look for water damage- it's fresh).  The back of the building is against another university dorm (there was a lot of noise).  There are safety issues (front door not always locked, security letting anyone in, no record keeping of who goes in and out of private rooms- we had thefts of women's underwear while there from workers being allowed into rooms unsupervised.  Emails notifying students said they did not have to be present for room entry and were encouraged to go about their routines.  Problem was, electronics, jewelry, and clothes went missing as a result and the staff did nothing) that were not fixed while I was there for a year.  The new management is cleaning up the mess the old one left so things may improve but most students felt the school cared less about them and more about the bottom line profit wise.

My partner and I stayed at Shepherd's from Thursday night to Monday as we were attending a 3 day event at the Excel Centre so the first thing I did when phoning around hotels in the area was to ask how long it would take to get to the Docklands Railway.  I was told by Mr and Mrs Shepherd that their B&B was a short walking distance away from London Bridge so I immediately booked.  In reality, London Bridge is an absolute trek and we were pretty annoyed that an honest answer hadn't been given as we had a 6.30am starts and very long days ahead.  The trek back to the hotel late at night wasn't very appealing either.  No mention or offer of being picked up as advertised on their site.  We received a pleasant welcome upon arrival and were", " greeted with a glass of wine (not champagne).   Mr and Mrs Shepherd presented themselves as a pair of dog-loving English eccentrics which was initially quite endearing however, my partner and I both felt as though we were intruding on the family home which made us feel slightly uncomfortable.      The room was ok with a bowl of apples and flowers however, it felt like one of their children's bedrooms.  There were also no locks on the doors and the dogs were able to enter which was a bit strange.  On a more positive note, as we had an early start in the morning, Mrs S offered to make a Continental breakfast which was appreciated so top marks there.  Unfortunately, our stay ended less than nicely.  On the Sunday night, we were informed that their credit card machine was broken so we would have to pay in cash - on reading the reviews, it seems as though the machine is permanently broken - does she not trust her customers?  We had a cooked breakfast on the Monday morning which was pretty poor and not very well cooked.  The portion sizes were mean and when I said I didn't eat eggs, I was not offered an alternative.  my partner's scrambled eggs were rubbery and cold and the dogs were underneath the breakfast table as we ate.  We felt Mrs Shepherd's tone change after breakfast and she became extremely abrupt and frosty.  She then demanded to know when we would be leaving as she had 'things to do' and barked that she 'didn't want us in the house' -  even though it was before check out time, and she became very unpleasant.  To my horror, I discovered that I had lost the \u00a360 which I withdrew the night before.  When I explained this and that I would have to write a cheque, Mrs S was very unsympathetic and barked that they didn't accept cheques.  This annoyed me as she could see I was visibly upset and it was obvious she thought I was trying to pull a fast one.  I explained that there was nothing else I could do so Mrs S ungraciously took the cheque.  She then became extremely unpleasant and asked us to leave, walking in on my boyfriend in the bedroom without knocking.  The atmosphere was extremely cold and unpleasant and we couldn't wait to leave.  Not even a goodbye or a thank you from either of the Shepherds.  There was no mention of the option to be given a lift and It was a horrible end to what started off as a decent long weekend which was a shame.  As we were leaving the hotel, we were completely ignored by Mr and Mrs S, not sure why, but this was extremely rude and we were relieved to go.  We would NEVER go back.  The eccentric dog-loving act wore thin by the end and we were a bit confused as to why they are running a B&B when they make it pretty clear it is THEIR house.  As I said, it felt as though we were intruding in the family home.  My lasting impression of Mrs Shepherd is that she is pompous and frosty.  I am sure there are better and more accommodating places.

The proprietors weren't even there when we arrived, leaving their young daughter to greet us (this despite advising them 3 times of our ETA as requested by Mrs Shepherd). there was no champagne on arrival for us, and no home made biscuits, and no fruit in the room, just some feeble flowers, all as specified in their website.  the bedding was old with holes in it.  our bed too was old and very creaky.  our ensuite shower room was shabby.

", "\u2026", "Do NOT even conisder this hotel if you have a toddler or young baby.  The room was shabby, the service only just adequate and we were made to feel like second class citizens.  Our son is two and on booking this fact was discussed. I made it clear that although he sleeps through the night at home, it could not be guaranteed if he was in a strange environment. Indeed, I did not book the Saturday night preceding the London marathon out of consideration for other guests.  On arrival at just after 6 pm on Thursday evening we were shown to our room. There was indeed a quarter bottle of sparkling wine (French, but not champagne). There were also fresh flowers and a bowl of apples.  However, there was also peeling wallpaper, and the floor under the bed was disgusiting. It was at least", " an inch think in dust and fluff and included such delights as a used sock, bag and slipper belonging to a previous occupant. Our son had been provided with a blow-up mattress.  This was adequate but hardly conducive to a good night's sleep. As for our bed, it should have been thrown out years ago. It rocked and squeaked every time you moved which drove us both mad. The bed linen was well-worn and the pillowcases had holes in them. Furthermore, there was no decent mattress protector. I am 19 weeks' pregnant and put towels underneath me in case of any problems with my waters breaking - just in case. I would hate to leave a soiled bed but can only guess at what previous occupants might have done. The curtains were shabby, unlined and did not meet and the window would not shut. There was no means of locking your door - one has to presume that other guests are honest.  The meal at \u00a325 a head was merely adequate for the money. I would have expected the bottle of Semillon Chardonnay to be chilled and the food not to actually be out on the table when we sat down at 8.05 pm (dinner was at 8 pm).  We all had a dreadful night's sleep (not assisted by the fact that the previous occupant had set the alarm at 6 a.m and this had not been altered - our son awoke and would not go back to sleep as the room was light.)  Breakfast was at 9 am so we occupied our son by reading him stories and then my husband took him for a walk in the garden. Mrs Shepherd made a particularly friendly comment about him waking up so early. What do you expect in a hotel? Is everyone supposed to sleep until 8.30 a.m? He was no noisier than any other two year old. He was kept in the room, was not alllowed to run around, and sat up in bed with us reading stories.  His voice is piping but that, I am afraid, is that.  At breakfast our son talked to other guests and sat up at the table to eat his breakfast. He is perfectly capable of eating with a knife, fork and spoon and is well-mannered - saying please and thank you, and asking permission to get down from the table. He is not, however, as capable of conducting himself as an adult, and does drop food on the table.  That evening we arrived back at the hotel and discovered our quarter bottle of \"Champagne\" had been removed. Seemingly if you do not feel like drinking it on arrival then you cannot have it the next night! We went to bed early as we feared Alexander would wake early again. The Shepherds received guests at gone 10 pm which woke us all up. There are stripped wood floors everywhere - including the stairs (perhaps, given the shabby nature of the rooms they also cannot afford good good quality stair runners) which means that the whole hotel echoes. The Shepherds' dog enjoyed a good bark at the new visitors.  We felt that this was fair though. We did not expect the hotel to be totally silent and we are well aware that not everyone keeps to the same hours. However, we did expect a bit of give and take. The Shepherds' private room was next to ours and when my husband and son went to use the bathroom the next morning (at 6.40 a.m - after another sleepness night) my son was told by Mrs Shepherd to \"get back in his room as other guests were sleeping\". My husband and son needed to use the lavatory. They were not playing football on the landing!  Mrs Shepherd had advised us that \"perhaps Alexander might like breakfast at 8.45\" the folllowing morning. In other words, we were being segregated. The whole affair was rushed as her other guests were breakfasting at 9 am, and we had one bowl of scrambled eggs (burnt) between two adults and only 3 half slices of toast. I noted on departure when I went to say good morning to another guest that the second sitting had been provided with scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, plus an apple tart. How sad. Smoked salmon is one of my son's favourite foods but we were obviously not worthy of it.  We paid our money (which incidentally is as good as everyone else's) and left. I will ensure that I tell everyone how badly we were treated and will advise my friends that another B&B would be a better choice.  Shepherds is shabby chic run by an inveterate snob. I too have travelled extensively and have lived all over the world. I, however, have learnt tolerance and respect for others which sadly the propritetor of this hotel has not.

NO FIRE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET.  Eight people, one bathroom. Considering the house is equipped with five (?or more) separate sleeping spaces, each able to sleep ?2 people, there are not enough facilities to accommodate this amount of people. The shared bathroom situation I regard as both a PRIVACY and convenience issue. If you have the unfortunate circumstance of sharing with other guests (we had two separate sets of guests as well as our family sharing - eight people total), the bathroom situation can become tricky to navigate. The house seemed more like a budget student", " share-house situation rather than a B&B, which is disappointing considering the amount of money that was spent for five nights stay for five people.  First impressions were far below average. We were never actually greeted by the owners/managers and were left to bumble around and guess which rooms are ours. An actual formal greeting/introduction would have been nice. An e-mail was provided, but it still was confusing. It was later left to us, the guests, to greet and show around OTHER guests staying. Very awkward and confusing. They assumed we were the owners, as the owners never showed up while they were there either.   A \"house keeper\" came by three times in the five days - we were told she was to come daily to tidy up the common shared areas and restock supplies, but it was apparent the only time the house keeper visited was to drop off milk and was gone again in less than two minutes. We ran out of toilet paper (again, eight people one toilet) with two days left in our stay.  Take note; \"breakfast included\" means \"help yourself to frozen muffins and bread in the freezer\". There were cereals provided and long life juices (Tesco brand food), but this was the extent of the \"included breakfast\". There were two tiny tables in the kitchen and only room to seat three people at any one time - again it is hard to see how eight people were meant to manage this situation without it being awkward and stumbling over each other. The kitchen was a shared situation, like the fridge, and was tight and awkward space to navigate in the mornings and nights sharing with other guests. Not to mention, the horrid amount of mould growing on the walls above the cabinets, the greasy cook-top and other guests' dirty dishes in the sink.   The garden - beautiful it is not. Overgrown & weedy, home to local cats and with the neighbouring fences collapsing in on the garden. It was dangerous and a little scary, we did not dare attempt to go out there, for it was hard to see the path at all.   The beds had a lot to be desired. We stayed in the lounge room (ground floor) on a thin mattress fold out bed. Bed sheets/covers were worn and had rips/holes. There were lots of potted plants sitting around, water sitting in trays, not appealing. It was very cluttered with the owners' personal items, creepy dusty stuffed toys, books, etc. The lounge was comfortable and roomy and the only good aspect about the room. It was also the only room with a television. As advertised on here (you can see the photo) it was meant to be a 50\" HD flat screen TV, instead we got an almost ancient tiny analogue system. There was no advertised stereo system or PC set up. The heaters turned on sporadically during the night and were off most of the time despite our attempts to turn them on. The rooms were cold as a result and it made it hard to dry  towels/washing.   A washer/dryer combo was provided in the kitchen but not worth the hassle, considering the dryer component of it didn't work adequately.   The other bed provided for our family was a fold-out sofa bed (top attic room) with a thin mattress, and then three singles in another room on middle floor. One of these beds was so uncomfortable that no one attempted to sleep in it.   The bathroom was nice and clean for the most part, but was a bit grubby by day two and was never cleaned by the \"housekeeper\". The towels provided were stained and old. Fresh towels were provided in a common hall stand, but all disappeared on day two.   There was washing on a rack drying in the kitchen upon our arrival and was not taken down/removed until day three. It made navigating the small kitchen with lots of people even harder.   The neighbourhood was okay. There was only one place to eat (a pub). Thankfully, the underground is only a 10 min walk from the house and was about 30 min trip to central London sightseeing.   Parking was free, if you managed to get a park and keep it for the duration. Very crowded street.   Street backs onto above ground rail station, so noisy at night.   Rooms are not very sound-proofed. Our room was right next to the front door, so we heard other guests coming in and out at night. While everyone was obviously cautious not to make too much noise, it was inevitable.   The wifi provided was very good. This was one of the few good aspects of the house.  Overall, it was not a comfortable five night stay. It was not very professionally run, considering we never saw/met the owners. The share situation with the bathroom is probably the WORST aspect, next to how overpriced it was.   Only stay here if you're comfortable sharing a bathroom with strangers.", "\u2026", "For a start there is only one bathroom which in our case had to accommodate 8 people. 5 of us, one semi permanent resident and a couple from Europe.

Il punto forte del Soma Caberwell \u00e8 la posizione strategica; Camberwell \u00e8 gi\u00e0 di per se un quartiere comodo perch\u00e9 poco distante da tutte le principali attrazioni della capitale inglese. In particolare la struttura vanta la fortuna di trovarsi esattamente di fronte alla fermata di autobus di diverse linee (prima tra tutte la linea 12 che consente di arrivare a Westminster, Covent", " Garden o altre mete d'interesse). La stazione pi\u00f9 vicina della metro \u00e8 Denmark Hill che personalmente sconsiglio perch\u00e9 resta comunque un po' lontana da raggiungere a piedi, o comunque fa perdere tempo utile per visitare altre chicche della citt\u00e0.  Per quanto riguarda la stanza. Personalmente ho soggiornato in un flat del gruppo 17; era una camera doppia con bagno interno. Per chi non \u00e8 abituato, l'organizzazione degli appartamenti stupir\u00e0 un poco perch\u00e9 qui dei gruppi di stanze condividono spazi comuni esterni come una living room e la cucina. Per quanto mi riguarda non ho mai usufruito n\u00e9 della cucina n\u00e9 del salotto perch\u00e9 non ne ho mai avuto la necessit\u00e0, visto che ho sempre mangiato in citt\u00e0. La camera doppia ha un letto matrimoniale, scrivania con sedia e cassetti, armadio abbastanza capiente \u00e8 un bagno molto piccolo ma con l'essenziale (doccia, lavandino e wc); manca il phon, mentre invece troverete gi\u00e0 lenzuola ed asciugamani.  La struttura ha anche un Wi-Fi gratuito che richiede una breve iscrizione anche con credenziali fittizie.  Un ultimo punto di forza di questo posto \u00e8 il Rooftop Garden, ossia la terrazza panoramica accessibile a tutti che offre una vista dello skyline londinese davvero invidiabile.

One of the windows in the bedroom doesn't even open and the area looking out from the hallway/kitchen (I'm guessing a fire escape) is disgusting, full of again cigarette ends and dirt. The most disappointing of all was the cleanliness of the place, we found so many long black hairs all over the flat, even on my daughters towel and I ended up hoovering on the 2nd morning it got that bad.  There was also a packet of cigarettes and a lighter left in the wardrobe, my children were sleeping in that bedroom and luckily didn't get hold of them. My husband and daughter have both been bitten several times, I can't say it's from the flat but given the cleanliness it seems likely. Quite frankly all this ruined our whole experience and i would not reccomend this place to anyone. It was overhaul just filthy and unhygienic!! We contacted the company when we were leaving to be told if we had complained they would have sent housekeeping in, but I complained about the broken toilet seat within an hour of arrival and nothing was done. Also housekeeping had supposedly been in before arrived.  We couldn't have the windows open (the ones that did open) due to a very noisy air con machine outside and the fact we were directly above 2 pubs where people were outside smoking till 11pm every night, it was incredibly noisy not to mention the smell of smoke from the people on the streets.

The residence is very quiet and lodges city professionals as well as students from the University of East London. It is definitely NOT what we expected to be honest.

There is nowhere to go out, there is no life on this estate, and the nearest shopping centre is a 20-min walk on an isolated road. I honestly wish I could say better things but this is not your typical aparthotel or even serviced apartment, in fact there are posters saying that there is mice infestation (ha) in the building. When we asked the so-called receptionist about these, he denied everything.... we were shocked - because if you pass the security office, they will refuse to help you and claim that this business operates illegally. I am not trying to ruin anyone's experience, but the photos from booking.com or even their own website are nowhere near what you find AT THE RESIDENCE... I think this business needs to sort itself out.

This was important to us as we were 2 couples meeting up so needed independent wash and shower facilities each morning.  The in-house company rep (property manager) Venicio was very helpful and was able to locate an alternative apartment for us which had 2 showers.  However, due to a number of other issues we elected to remain in our original allocated apartment (defective dishwasher, missing leaves from the vertical blinds,", " broken wardrobe door and a general feeling of darkness).  There were no table and chairs on the balcony to allow us to sit outside in the evening and enjoy the wonderful view.  Again Venicio proved to be very helpful and managed to conjour up a table and 4 chairs. There were only 3 chairs around the dining table ... Again Venicio changed these 3 chairs for 4 others which enabled us to all sit and eat together. Although 1 or these had a dodgy back rest (which I unsuccessfully attempted to repair). Several of the door handles (including the main entrance door) were loose and came off in your hand when you pulled on them to open the door (which I again repaired). We thought that a mirror in the second bedroom would be a useful addition. It was nice to have a television in the bedrooms, however it  would have been more aesthetically pleasing if the cables had been hidden from view,  ....perhaps in some \u201ctrunking\u201d. There were insufficient pots, pans and kitchen implements, mismatched crockery, Once again Venicio was able to assist and we borrowed some bits and pieces from an unoccupied apartment. There were a number (5) of light bulbs not working and no spares to replace them with.  We did not mention this to Venicio.  The dishwasher needed some maintainance to the shelves as they were very unstable.   The ceramic hob was dirty with baked on grime.  Venicio explained this was old and could not be removed.  We purchased some \u201cHob-brite\u201d from the nearby Tesco\u2019s and had it cleaned in a matter of minutes .... Venicio assured us that he would be speaking to the cleaning contractor about this. We had been aware of the apartments closeness to the City Airport but were not expecting to be virtually under the flight-path with planes taking off/landing every few minutes from 0650hrs every morning. The apartment information really needs to be expanded a little  ... i.e. where do you dispose of your rubbish.

Being asked to refer to terms and conditions after payment that was different to booking.com was the 1st red flag, The 2nd was me having to find the terms and conditions as the link they gave didn't work, the 3rd was adding further terms and conditions in an email that was different to their own website and further, booking.com Many being explicit which I had no issues", " with and one being rather vague, can you spot which one it might be when you have two kids of 6 and 8.

It appeared with the assistance of David, the booking process was smoothed over and he had made some headway in regaining my trust and confidence. Although the 4th red flag was when I asked if partying and the behaviour described was commonplace in the vicinity of their apartments - I got no response to this question.  Anyway, we received our entry instructions and had a lovely journey down to London as a family, and looking ahead to our departure time had requested a late checkout, this came with a fee, no issues there, they required 24 hours notice for this late departure, I gave them some 4-5 days.  LONDON/ACCOMMODATION We arrived at our apartment, it was clean and adequate but definitely not luxurious. We had a great evening exploring the surrounding area and realised we were in a very vibrant and fantastic location. Valet Apartments followed up with an email to check if we arrived okay if we had any issues to get in touch. We were on a high until we tried to fall asleep. We couldn't  The accommodation provider failed to notify us that we were in a highly sociable area, a little heads-up and we could have brought earplugs. Their attempt at using a rather cheap secondary glass pane to act like double glazing was poor. The double bed was fit for hobbits and not two adults and they could have provided fans for the hot weather.  This was all fed back, in amongst the internet not working. The internet was fixed 24 hrs after arrival and there was a suggestion we might get a fan, it never came.  LONDON We didn't allow Valet Apartments to dampen our stay, we had a great time at Lego Land, We enjoyed the bus tour (Would stick with yellow line only), we enjoyed the boat as part of the bus tour. We enjoyed the sights, the bars and restaurants, it was all fabulous.  LBGT  It had come to our attention on the Thursday eve of our stay that there would be a huge LGBT march in London on that Saturday and that we would likely find it difficult leaving our accommodation and getting transport in time unless we left in a timely fashion.  BACK TO VALET APARTMENTS SHOCKING SERVICE Given that VA requested that I needed to provide them 24 hours to request a late checkout, which was done 4-5 days prior, it stood to reason that I could give the same notice to cancel this. With 25 hours until their normal early departure, they were informed of our desire to leave early due to the information we had learned. What followed was a circus. It had come to my attention they had already charged for the late checkout and after umpteen emails, their manager Kelvin offered me my late checkout fee refund of \u00a330 if I booked another accommodation within 24 hours.  So to make that clear, I am enjoying the last day of my holiday, and I am being asked to book another holiday for a paltry amount in the scale of things before I check out.  I asked on 3 occasions where in their terms it advised that my 25 hours notice wasn't enough - No reply to that one either.

My first stop was Argos to buy some towels as there were none provided (except one that looked like it had been used to suffocate a rat).

One in particular was extremely dirty and unhygienic that I came back to my flat after being away to the place looking like a bomb had hit it. There were bugs flying everywhere... What was even more disgusting was that this flatmate was not punished or told off by staff but time and time again was left to get away with it when she did not clean up after herself at all. She even dumped her rubbish illegally outside the hostel and the staff tried to pin this on me by sending me a warning letter without even asking me when it clearly wasn't my fault and caused me a", " lot of stress.   The staff were clearly inadequate in sorting this out and with bad flatmates of whom I had two while staying at parkhouse. The first flatmate I had who caused me a lot of problems was allowed to stay in the flat so I had to move when I was actually the first one in. Utterly disgusting.   The cleaners left my room unlocked one time while I was away and I could have had my belongings stolen... When told about this they fobbed me off telling me the card machine had broke and that they were unable to tell who cleaned my room that day when in actual fact they would have had some record of who it was and were just covering their backs.   The staff sit at reception and the majority of them are lazy and deliver a poor customer service, they never smile when greeting you and can be quite rude at times.    I found Serge Kabongo to be totally unhelpful, arrogant and rude speaking to my new flatmate about me (who was a friend) implying to her that I was to be kept an eye on after my bad, stressful flatmate expereience which is totally unprofessional and completely unacceptable a very rude man.  None of the staff said goodbye to me when I left and wouldn't help with the doors when I was taking all my belongings with me.  I would NOT advise staying here at all, it is not worth the money or hassle you get for your loyalty. The staff all seriously need a customer service course on how to treat its customers.

However the proximity to the underground, supermarkets and restaurants made it very", " good value for money. It probably varies by person but I stayed for 62 nights on the 8th floor over summer in an 'apartment' with one other bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge shared with another apartment next door. Throughout my whole stay the other bedroom was only occupied twice - once for two nights, the other time one - so I essentially had a private space which was fantastic. The lounge I shared with the other apartment was almost always occupied by a cranky older lady who watched TV all the time and when I moved in it was full of the previous occupants stuff so wasn't really usable. I personally didn't mind because despite my room sharing a wall with the lounge I couldn't hear the TV in there (only in the hall) so I wasn't bothered and I mostly just slept and ate there as I was interning full time in the city and out most evenings. I guess it would've been annoying if I had wanted to use it.. Also the communal/social/work spaces were out of use all summer so it definitely doesn't have the social vibe that people expect in some hostels but again I was so busy it didn't bother me. Overall, don't be put off by any of the horror reviews. The place is somewhat basic but comfortable, the communal areas - hallways, by the lift etc. - are a little dirty and there are dead insects but my room was spotless, the laundry facilities are pricey but very convenient and work well. It was good, beyond the expectations I had from other reviews and everything I'd wanted. I would recommend. (I read a review from someone who said they have a cinema room and gym and I think they're confused because they definitely do not! As I said it's a basic building, no luxuries but if that's what you want and expect then great. Also I was expecting it to be an all female hostel because that's what a lot of reviews said and I think it used to be that way but it isn't, both genders stayed there so if that's an issue for you, take note) My tip was too long so copying in full: I read that higher floors are better so stayed on the 8th which was good and had a great view! However I never went to other floors so can't really judge tbh.

I have raised this issue with the concierge, who informed me that he is keeping this door open on purpose to assist tenants who may struggle with the donor's heavy weight. He assured me that, since he is always at his desk, in case of an actual fire, he would quickly close the door. While I do appreciate the customer service considerations, I strongly object to placing convenience above safety. Keeping the door wedged open does not just create a hazard which the door is specifically designed to mitigate, it is also, by my", " understanding, illegal. Whenever I had to close to door, the desk was in fact unmanned.  COVID-19 safety: Several employees do not seem to understand or care about basic rules regarding the reduction of coronavirus infection risk. Not only have we had to remind housekeeping to please wear a mask, having knocked on our door without wearing one, when this is apparently (judging by the signage) mandatory in all common areas, several employees on the front desk also do not wear masks as far as we can tell whenever we walk past, a behaviour that extends to lift use. Now, perhaps employees are in fact tested daily, but this still would not fully mitigate risk of infection, and it sets a bad example for all residents when staff do not follow mandated procedures.  Housekeeping standards: When we moved in, we had to request renewed cleaning as the apartment was objectively not clean. Linked with the above concern, this was particularly surprising given the clear connection between improper disinfection of surfaces and the risk of covid spread. The latest round of cleaning, performed Tuesday afternoon, also left much to wish for.

I was there to work, so I woke early and only really was present in my room to sleep. Still, usually, you can get a single room for a similar price in a hostel, I will be doing that if need be next time around. I would not return here.   The location is good, although the entrance to the hotel is just a door and hard to find. (It's to the left side of the blue store, in the little alleyway). There is an Asda right across the street, a co-op and Tesco express are also really close (although Tesco runs out of meal deals incredibly quickly, be there between 9 and 9.10 in the", " morning or they're all gone). It is just a few minutes away from Stepney Green Underground station, and ten minutes away from Whitechapel. As I was working at an office a few stops away, this was incredibly convenient.  There are also plenty of places to eat around there, and if you take out it is easy to stay under 5 pounds. This is convenient as the kitchen facilities at the hotel are no longer in true working order. No plates or bowls available, and the clothes washer and dryer are taped shut.   Now for all which I wasn\u2019t exactly pleased with\u2026 The building is old, which of course cannot be helped, but due to this, and due to someone having smoked in there, the smell of smoke seems to have seeped into the walls. Whenever I turned the heating on, the smell would make an appearance, which was a real shame. The walls and the ceiling also showed signs of wear, they could do with a touch-up. It was also concerning to me that the fire alarm seems to have been removed. Presumably, because the smoke smell keeps setting it off, but it feels unsafe.   Also, they could have been better at cleaning. I stayed at my room for 11 nights and upon arrival, it wasn't what I call incredibly clean. Everything was dusty, the remote was sticky, and the bedding was dirty. When I mentioned the bedding, it was immediately replaced, so plus-points for that... But in regards to the rest of the room, it did not get cleaned once during my stay. While this did help me feel like my stuff was safe during the day as nobody was entering my room, 11 days is quite long to go without a proper hoover. I've kept the room clean myself with makeup wipes.   In regards to the complaints about not having fresh towels, I got one every other day, but this did mean bringing your dirty one to reception to get it swapped. As the staff is not present for the whole day, I can imagine that missing them would be easy. Also, the staff is iffy. Some are quite nice, others are incredibly rude, customer service doesn\u2019t seem to be a word in their dictionary. One even got cross with me because I did not have electricity for the TV and heater (a fuse blew) as if that somehow was my fault?   In regards to the bathroom facilities, when originally booking I was convinced that I would have an ensuite. It was not made clear to me that all facilities would be shared. Thankfully, I don't mind this, so this wasn't a huge problem. These were cleaned twice a day so never found toilets or showers incredibly dirty. I also managed to get the water scalding hot for showers but that means fiddling around with the settings a bit. Appears that this is only possible on the second door of the showers, so be sure to pick that one! Just don't look up during the showers, as the entire ceilings are overgrown with mould.

As this was the most irritating thing about our visit we also were told that there wasn't any parking so we had to pay another \u00a325 for parking across the road for the privilege .  Customer service very poor!  Do not stay there!!!!! ", "Do not book with this company or apartment. Booked through booking.com sent all the information that was needed to them myself as the lead passenger but then changed to my friend she sent her ID, on the day of the arrival we kept calling that mobile number with no ring straight to cutting us off we text it nothing.

I booked to stay at the Belvedere Stratford city apartments as myself and 5 friends were attending an event on Sunday 20th of August.  In the lead up to our stay I received several emails requesting ID, Card details and I requested parking to which was confirmed also which was as expected.  On Friday the 18th I sent an email just to confirm the parking, but received no response.   I then tried to call 4 times on Saturday the 19th to check the booking and ensure everything was ok, and was grew quite concerned as the 2 phone numbers provided on my correspondence emails were no going through.They at this point took a \u00a3250 safety deposit so had taken approx. \u00a3400 by this point  020 3095 1000 keep going through to voicemail and the mobile", " number 07956459938 I was getting \u2018the mobile phone you have called is not available\u2019  I left things until Sunday and hoped for the best.  We were travelling from Stamford (Lincolnshire) by car, so a 192 mile trip. On the way, I tried to call both numbers approximately 20 times between the hours of 1pm through to 4pm.  The landline number had an option for any emergencies to press 1 \u2013 I tried this, and then it rang off to a voicemail. I left a voicemail to explain the situation and could someone call me back urgently as I was getting rather stressed by this point as we had to be at an event no later than 4pm.  We decided to go the event and at regular interval keep trying to call the numbers and hopefully once through,   By 5pm we had to start looking online for other hotels and the only place we could find was 3 separate rooms in Ilford (Ogradys bar) and pay \u00a380 per room, so \u00a3240 in total.  We had to take a taxi to Ilford which cost us \u00a335 and the accommodation on top ended up costing an extra \u00a3126.50 that we anticipated and to top this off, the \u00a3250 reservation is still being retained off of my card.  I received a whatspp at 18:32 from Belvedere (on the same mobile number that constantly said \u2018the mobile number you are calling is not available) to say they had been trying to contact me with no luck and that they would keep the check in desk open until 7pm.  At this point, I tried to phone the mobile AGAIN and YET AGAIN, there was the same message.  I feel this was a complete scam and am absolutely appalled at the way the apartments contact strategy and phone system does not work.  Not only did they spoil what was meant to be a great day out with friends but they have also cost me extra money and form what my email reads I will be charged \u00a3148.50 because they can\u2019t answer the phone so we could be shown an apartment that we had paid for  Never stay here - or should I say try to stay here!", "\u2026", "On arrival ( after phoning reservations) eventually met by the booking in clerk who informed us that we would not be staying at these booked apartments but one \"just up the road\" belonging to the same group- we were not informed of its name or of this change before our arrival.

The bedroom walls, door, window, fixtures and fittings were all rank with dirt. We found short and curly", " hairs in the bedding. The futon was full of stains. The curtain was a full foot too short for the window and was also disgusting with stains. The window sill was grotty and in disrepair. There was a band conducting a warm-up for their gig that evening in the bar below. The vibrations of this could be felt through the floor and this clashed with the din from a speaker which had been placed outside the hostel door.   Bathroom Bonanza: There were two bathrooms located just a short walk down the corridor. Again the walls are appallingly dirty and marked. Both bathrooms were in a poor state of repair. The furthest away from our room was the better quality of the two. However, it had no holder for the shower, the cistern lid was cracked in half and there was a sodden and stinky shower mat crumpled up behind the door. The other bathroom had holes in the toilet seat, a shower curtain full of mould, the extractor fan half hanging off the ceiling held on with masking tape and full of mould, and the shower head holder attached with tape. It also had a stinky soaked shower mat. It is hard to say which room smelt worse, they were pretty much on a par for their assault on our senses.   One Night Stand: We quickly dropped our bags and made a swift dash for closest boozer. We decided we'd give the place a chance. But knew we'd need to be seriously smashed to survive the night. Challenge accepted. We returned around midnight, closed the window and were thankfully drunk enough to manage to get our heads down. Unfortunately, the pub directly beneath our room is open until 4am, and once our skinfuls had worn off, regardless of the closed window, we were awoken by the noise and vibration. The room had also become uncomfortably hot and a few hours of ruinously broken sleep ensued. We went for breakfast up the street and decided that another night in this place could break us. We booked another place a couple of miles away and checked out. We advised the chap at reception that we were booked for another night but we're leaving and asked for our key deposit back, he returned it without any issues. It is also worth noting that he seemed entirely unsurprised we were going and made no attempt to ascertain the reasona for us doing so. But I suppose its fairly obvious.   Realistic: As previously mentioned I think our expectations ere realistic about the quality of what we would experience at this hostel. However, it felt unsafe, unsecure, and unsanitary. There's clearly little to no cleaning that goes on and the upkeep of the establishment is extremely poor. We felt the need to bar the door with a chest of drawers at night (which revealed dust and grime behind where it was originally placed) as there was no additional internal security measure to secure the door. We felt the need to wear shoes when walking round the room due to putrid state of the establishment. I would imagine you can get better quality for less elsewhere. My advice would be to do so.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "37", "attractions_nearby": "6", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "88", "top_cuisines": ["Bar", "Bar", "Bar", "Cafe"]},

There was no response, it was freezing cold outside, so I sent another email cancelling the booking. I then booked myself into the excellent Crowne Plaza but at \u00a3120 for the night. The reservation was non-refundable on the Expedia site, but since the property was not able to provide the service paid for this is not acceptable.

Bedrooms also did not have locks.  One review noted they did not feel safe to leave their belongings in their room.  Another stated there was also a large gap under the door to their room which allowed anyone to gain entry.  In my view this was completely unacceptable.  Further complaints talked of dirty rooms, difficulty with wifi and TV reception, soiled towels, terrible beds which they could feel the springs through.

Firstly, I must express my dissatisfaction at the misleading nature of the listing on Booking.com. I chose the apartments because of their proximity to Farringdon Underground Station. The property address was listed as 1 Benjamin Street, however we were allocated properties half a mile away in Laystall Street.\u00a0  Secondly, it was not made clear until after making the booking, that key collection takes place at an address in Aldgate, and furthermore that all individuals staying in the apartme Niamh'sbooking, and on investigation I found that cancelling would have resulted in losing 100% of the booking cost.  After receiving the keys, it was pointed out to us that the required number of beds had", " not been made up in one of the apartments.

I was told that all the booking conditions were present in the small print, however I do not believe it is too much to expect that when an apartment address is advertised, it is that apartment that is allocated, not one within a 30 minute radius. As a result of this misleading information I resolved not to book apartments managed by your company in the future.  My main reason for writing, however, is that at 1am in the morning, one of my colleagues discovered bed bugs in her bed, on the walls, in the wardrobe and bathroom of Flat 5. I have attached pictures as evidence. She has subsequently discovered a number of bites that were not present before staying in the apartment.  The discovery of bed bugs led to both colleagues staying in Flat 5 to sleep on the sofa in Flat 3 resulting in poor sleep for all.  I have taken advice from a colleague in Public Health who has advised that in order to prevent transferring the bed bugs to our own homes, all the clothing that could have come into contact with the insects should be destroyed, including any suitcases. I have been further advised that in order to eradicate the insects, the entire apartment must be treated with a suitable insecticide. We believe that the infestation had been present for a considerable time given that my colleague saw both adult and juvenile insects.

So as to the description says and doesn't say: lift access - but no lights in the lift balcony - couldn't find this, unless you count the siding doors as windows, with nothing but air to step out on to. double glazing - yes heating - but turned off ironing facilities - on requested and then the iron was broken full kitchen - if you can", " can cook with the bare minimum Fridge/Freezer - the one positive  Double Bed - in both rooms, but one had a mattress you could feel the springs through and the cheap box divan was broken so the mattress was resting on the outside frame Oven/Hob - we ate out as there was in sufficient cooking utensils.   seating area - if you call one bed and a sofa along one wall a seating area sofa - couldn't find this, there was a single bed in the living room instead with a sofa bed soundproofing - really? we could hear the loud road traffic, each other in different rooms, even with the doors shut and the screaming kid next door! washing machine - gave up looking if it was there wooden/parquet floor, bath - a small one bathroom amenities - not sure what this meant, but there was a token hotel shampoo and shower bottle on the arrival, hairdryer on request - this WAS in the sitting room! DVD player - couldn't find any evidence of  one of these LCD/Plasma/Flat Screen TV, dining area - with 4 old and broken chairs dishwasher electric kettle - thank goodness kitchenware - very basic, no coffee press, no teapot no kitchen linen, no bottle opener, and I could go on microwave on request, that arrive the following day.

What was", " actually in the room was a double bed, drawers + mirror, kettle + teaspoon (no mugs!) tiny flat 'chair' blocking the wardrobe from opening, and a cupboard high up filled with junk.  Not even sure if it was cleaned- found a bag full of MOULDY takeaway in the drawer! When showing the one staff member he just said 'oh' and put it in the kitchen.How can i be sure that the room was cleaned at all if the cleaner didn't see a bright blue bag in the draw? I found it within 3 minutes of being in the room.   The doors for all the rooms are ridiculously thin and crappy. The locks are pathetic and just stop you twisting the door knob. \"Free toiletries\" are just one tiny tube of shower gel. The bed/bedding sucked anyway, rough duvet and a flat/flimsy pillow per person (which ended up slipping down the back of the bed due to the style of the frame with big gaps).  Staff: We had trouble finding the property as it's listed as #26 Jubilee street which turned out to be residential property so we tried calling the number left as contact details. They didn't pick up MANY times and we were about to ditch it and find somewhere else to stay until they finally picked up and said their phone was about to die and that they'd ring us back in 5 mins. 20 mins later, we try ringing them again and they pick up- they weren't very helpful explaining where the property was so we sat outside of the area it was in. (it's a building within a few blocks of flats)   We rang again when we were sat outside and the lady answered saying that she can't come find/let us in because her dinner was ready! Ridiculous and no idea of customer service. Leaving customers outside in the cold because you're wanting to eat dinner?? 10 mins later a man came and got us and showed us which building it was and let us in.   As soon as we were inside he straight up demanded the money (which is fine as we were expected to pay upon arrival but he was rude). I asked if they'll take card (having assumed they would have an actual reception, but no.) and he said no, cash only. Obviously we weren't carrying \u00a3100+ cash on us and asked where the nearest cash point was. Instead he then insisted i pay via Paypal which was also fine. However, we had to wait around for a LONG time for the lady to send an invoice/money request. I suggested I just send it straight if they gave me the paypal address but they 'didn't know' what the address was.After I had paid i showed him the confirmation of the money being sent and he finally left. No welcome, no thanks, no 'have a good evening', nothing.   Didn't see anyone after that, not even when we checked out. When booking the room they asked when we wanted to check in/out but on the fridge a notice said checkout was 11am. considering they said we could stay until 5pm previously, I emailed them asking if we could still stay until 5 or if we had to leave at 11.

I had to walk to the shop from the property carrying my heavy suitcase.  (2) The property has 6 rooms, but have only 2 bathrooms. In addition, one of the 2 bathrooms was terrible. (That bathroom did not have soap.)  (3) The room had several defects. For example, a knob of the one of the windows was broken, I was not able to close the window in rainy/cold London winter weather. (I leant out of another window and closed the window in question", " from the outside \u2013 in a room at 3F which was a little bit dangerous.)  (4) While I do not know the cleaning cycle, the toilet rolls in the bathrooms run out on a day. I was forced to purchase several toilet rolls out of my pocket.  (5) There were one laundry machine, and one drying machine. However, the drying machine was broken.  (6) The property has three doors, (i) outside entrance door (common to all rooms), (ii) inside entrance door (common to all rooms), and (iii) individual room door. The (i) was a little bit hard to unlock because (I guess) the door and door lock were so old. One day, some guest forcibly turned his/her key in the keyhole, and the key twisted off, and the edge of the key remained in the key hole. When I returned to the property on a night, I found it, and was not able to insert my key into the keyhole. Then, I called the support center, and received the following instruction from the staff: (a) There is no other OYO rooms available close to the property. You have to find out a hotel you stay tonight by yourself. (b) I do not have any authority to compensate such the alternative stay fee. (c) I can offer some discount / coupon for my next time stay in OYO.

I emailed many times, each time confirming I didn\u2019t have to use the app. Despite this I kept receiving emails telling me to connect and I had to go through the whole process again- this happened many times. I was repeatedly asked to upload a photo of my passport onto this app. I feel very strongly that it is not acceptable to ask for", " customers to send a copy of sensitive documents such as passports via an app nor is it ok to have a photo taken of passports on check in. I travel extensively and this has not happened since the 1980s. I have no problem providing ID on check in but taking photos is not ok! The following is my view of the current issues with this apartment.   Apartment Positives  The apartment is in a great location, is a good size, is quiet, has well equiped kitchen and good wifi.   Apartment Negatives  This apartment in its current state should not be referred to as deluxe. It is at best very tired and in need of serious maintenance. Issues include  General  No explanation provided in writing or verbally about how to use heating, heated bathroom towel rails etc etc Bathrooms not clean We had to clean the washing machine and dishwasher prior to use as they were both dirty Dirty tea towels left in washing machine  Iron was broken- was quickly replaced when we asked but was replaced with another iron where the cover that stops the water leaking out kept falling off...didn\u2019t bother asking for another one Walls and skirting boards very dirty  Main Bedroom/ensuite  Down Light by door flickers Sewer smell in ensuite to main bedroom Large overhead shower doesn\u2019t work in the ensuite bathroom Toilet roll holder broken Window Blind does not go all the way down to the ground in bedroom therefore doesn\u2019t block out light  Second bedroom   There is no way you could get two people comfortably in the second bedroom. It really should only have a single bed.the small double bed takes up the whole room. Nowhere to hang anything in the second bedroom  Main Bathroom Handle broken on shower screen Tap knobs fall off in shower.   Kitchen  Plug in sink doesn\u2019t work so you cannot fill the sink to do dishes as the water constantly drains out.  All in all I would not use Sweet Inn again and could not comfortably recommend using sweet inn.  This email was intended to provide Sweet Inn constructive criticism to improve their services and offerings and was not originally intended for trip advisor.

During the stay 2 officers knocked on the door asking if we were staying \"short term\" (we stayed 4 nights).  When we said Yes they told us the owners were in trouble!      Other (permanent) residents were understandably very hostile to us, even refusing to let us in the building when we forgot our key.   We were so fed up we checked into a hotel for the same price and got back to having a proper holiday! ", "Given its proximity to Piccadilly and Central London, this Company should be sitting pretty with these central apartments. But they really work hard - at making sure their customers (their idea of hospitality doesn't seem to manage the notion that the folks who pay the money over might fall to be treated as guests) have a truly terrible time with them.Looking through some of the reviews (which I wish I'd done before booking) my experience was not unique and prompts me to post this review and secondly makes me want to warn off other unsuspecting visitors. It was a classic example (thankfully unusual these days) of all the problems with online booking.  I booked online and the confirmation voucher told me I had to pick up keys from Jubilee Court Hotel, Queensway. On arriving, I", " began to feel a bit uneasy. I had expected some WooGo office or at least some representative. The hotel looked like a low rental hostel. You haul your luggage up a very narrow stained stairway to the first floor reception which doubles as a hair salon. A bored receptionist (bored only I think by the frequency with which this happened) told me WooGo \"no longer operated\" from that address. Not the happiest of things to hear when you've trekked in 30 degrees to pick up keys for an apartment you know is a tube trip away. I called the number given on the voucher to be told....WooGo \"no longer operated\" from that number! I began to suspect some scam but on my saying I thought I would  call the police the receptionist discovered another number and put me through. Bear with me, it gets worse. I wait an age being deafened by Muzak and finally get through to a very heavily accented (I think Israeli)telephonist. After various incoherent exchanges I finally wriggle out from her that, despite the address and the telephone number given, I should in fact pick up the keys over at an address in Kensington - another tube trip. I set off as instructed but thinking this is not great and wondering how I get my money back. Arriving at the address given, there again is no sign of WooGo. It is a terraced block of flats in a garbage-strewn sidestreet with no-one in sight. No one picks up the phone when I call. A good 15 minutes later, I finally get through. I have to go through my story from the beginning to be berated for turning up before 3pm. When I explain that I did so at their instruction - more yelling (and I mean yelling) ensues. I say I'm very unhappy about this and I cannot hang about as I have a 2pm appointment.  The response? I couldn't believe it - but the telephonist again yells at me , asking what was I doing fixing a 2pm appointment when I had to collect keys at 3pm. Hey WooGo maybe I should just keep you posted on all my movements! I bad temperedly set off AGAIN for another unnecessary tube trip. I reach the tube only to get another call asking me to go back to the address as they have located the keys (of course it transpires on my questioning that they were there all the time). Incidentally, all these calls are on my cellphone at my expense. I return  - but no one picks up the phone when I call, as instructed. Finally, I get through.It's maybe indicative that I got into the central hallway with some guys making a delivery who, when they overheard my frustrated exchanges, said \" Not WooGo again!\". Turns out I am collecting the keys from a wall-mounted safe deposit box with instructions given over my phone. Despite there being no mention of it at booking nor on my voucher, the telephonist tells me I need to return and repeat this procedure at check-out.Must be first instance of a check-out involving two Tube trips! I head wearily to the apartment having had to adjourn my appointment. Well the building is central and, blissfully, not far from the tube station. It looks like a converted office block. There is a concierge desk but no one is there throughout my stay. Which is a bit annoying - as the apartment door won't work despite trying umpteen variations on the unmarked keys and two locks. Again, long delays in getting through to WooGo not helped by the fact that the telephonist I dealt with clearly had no idea where Piccadilly was never mind the apartment. I finally get into the apartment by pulling the door towards me while turning the key -why, of course! Silly me! The apartment is fine - bit spartan but I kind of like that. I head for a shower -not helped by the fact I find the showerhead lying in the bath. Cheap toiletries but thankfully I've brought my own. Bit of amateur plumbing and one tired sucker gets his shower. The apartment does bear a passing resemblance to the web photos posted -though no plasma TV. Bit scuffed but hey it's central London. I need a sleep but it's not helped by the street-noise (well Ok, my fault and price you pay for being central and I had packed ear-plugs) but I waken about 4am as the broken wooden slats in the bedroom area are letting the sunlight stream in. Oh Bliss! Very cheap towels and linens (were there the slightest chance I'd be back I'd pack my own) and a stained mattress (no protector -yeeeuucchhh) but generally apartment was fine. But for a \"special\" internet price of \u00a3140/$260 a night not my idea of a good deal! I can truthfully say -as someone who travels a lot - WooGo are possibly the WORST service (ha!) company I ever have dealt with over many years. Trust me, had I read a review like this - I'd have moved on to another provider. And on investigation, turns out they are a re-incarnation of the infamous YourStay who messed so many folks about they had to rebrand. You have been warned! And hey WooGo, the keys are on the worktop -where any sane renter would have asked that they should be left.

Once I got my self sorted I then took myself to the shared toilets/shower rooms, both disgusting, filled with hairs and dirt and mould, not even a lock on the shower or toilet doors. No towels or even toilet roll provided. I then decided to check the upstairs kitchen which was communally shared for staff and customers alike!. Needless to say it was dirty again.

I turned the bedding back and found stains, hairs and dirt, how on earth coud anyone sleep in here. I immediately wanted to pack my bag and go but it was around midnight and I couldn't. I had to improvise and use a t-shirt to cover the pillow and a jacket under my back and one over me to keep me warm. I felt so dirty but I needed sleep.

The afternoon tea was a late birthday gift for my dad and at the time I made the reservation, I had requested that there would be no sandwiches with white bread. I also advised that one of the people attending was a pescatarian. I also told the receptionist the afternoon tea was a birthday celebration. When we arrived on Sunday, the very first thing we were asked was whether or not we had pre paid.  We were then left to our own devices to work out where to sit, and eventually were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted.   We sat down at a table, which had sticky marks and so I had to ask the waitress to wipe the table. The waitress then asked what sort of tea we wanted. My dad selected coffee. I said I", " would like tea and asked what type of tea, she had. The waitress looked back blankly at me said, What kind of tea do you want? I then had to ask whether or not there was a menu of teas, which would give me an idea of the selection that was available . This was brought over and I ordered my tea. When the afternoon tea itself turned up there were white bread sandwiches, contrary to my request. Also, there were sandwiches with meat. Again, ignoring the fact that I had specified that one of the people attending was pescatarian. The sandwiches were average at best. There was one extremely strange stodgy white bread sandwich with cucumber, and I think about a half an inch of butter. It was deeply unpleasant and my dad who is not normally the sort of person to complain about anything said he'd never tasted anything quite like that before. The scones were small. Only one of them had fruit and so I offered that to my dad, his reply to me was, I like fruit scones but not burnt offerings. We were not told anything about the food that we were eating so had no idea about what was actually inside any of the sandwiches, nor what any of the sweets were. When I got up to go to the toilet. I told the waitress that we had requested pescatarian sandwiches and no white bread. She said that she hadn't been told anything by the front desk and wasn't aware of that request. I'm not sure why this would have been the case given that I gave front desk the information relevant to our booking at the time of making the reservation. The waitress managed to get additional sandwiches. These turned up about 10 minutes later, when we had already moved on to the scones. Neither the food nor service was in any way consistent with a 5 star hotel and it was totally different to my last visit to the Chelsea Harbour club for afternoon tea which was simply amazing. The whole experience felt slapdash, there was a lack of attention to detail and the quality of the food was poor. Certainly not fitting for a five star hotel.

No one came to our room to guide next steps, after repeated calls to the housekeeping and reception the duty manager came after 2 hours of checking in.

Max Rayne was a little different form other places I\u2019ve stayed. Rather than a hotel, it\u2019s a school resident for the University College London that provides short and long term accommodation during the summer.   The room was your typical dorm room. I got my own room w/ a twin bed (surprisingly comfortable). There was also a student desk, a sink, and internet. Since it\u2019s a dorm there were so many electric plugs available for you to use, which was great. The internet was free even though the website does say there would be a fee, but I was never charged. It isn\u2019t WIFI but they do provide you with an Ethernet cable if you need it.   There is a common kitchen and washroom. Max Rayne provided us with your", " typical hotel soap and a towel, everything else was on you to bring. But again, this was noted on the website.  The whole area where the dorm was located was very secure. There were a couple of dorms situated in one area all gated and fenced in. It was so secure that on check in I got a full key chain. This was fine since I went to London during the 2011 riots and having the iron gates really made me feel a little better. The dorms were a 10 minute walk to the nearest Underground (Camden), and even less to the Overground (Camden Town). Also, several buses stopped right on the door steps of the dorms. There are also grocery stores and restaurants everywhere.  In the end my experience in Max Rayne House was amazing. The price can't be beaten and the location is just stellar.   ***In the same vicinity was Ifor Evans Hall which also provided summer accommodation.

The exceptional head housekeeper to whom the previous reviewer, with his glaring and frankly inexplicable prejudices against all things \"Russian\" and \"red-haired\" refers, is a truly wonderful lady by the name of Irene/Irina, who has been toiling quite literally around the clock to keep the Park Avenue (previously \"Kadimah\") Hotel running for 15 years +.  If perhaps everything doesn't always run with absolutely clockwork precision, the sole reason appears to be under-staffing rather than any flaw whatsoever in the staff themselves, which seems to consist of Irene, an equally excellent,", " hard-working and longstanding manager who is, however, only physically present on the premises for c. 3 hours a day, and another part-time lady housekeeper - one can only assume the rest of the 14 staff apparently on the official payroll work remarkably brief hours, or are for some inscrutable reason very difficult to detect with the human eye. Yes, the hotel is indeed an older building and thus enjoys the character that comes with age; whilst the efforts of Irene and her colleagues are beyond reproach, it is perhaps worth bearing this in mind if you are the sort of person for whom operating-theatre levels of cleanliness are a necessity. Similarly, the walls between the rooms are certainly not thick, and one can quite often hear a great deal of what is going on in the room next door, which may be worth bearing in mind before booking for some.

When I phoned about my booking, Neil [--] the 'contact' claimed he had not received a confirmation email. He proceeded to advise me to call his colleague Dalva.  Dalva met my girlfriend and I at the apartments. The stair light doesn't work, the apartment itself was on floor 3 and my pregnant girlfriend found this hard going. The fact it was on floor 3 wasn't an issue; the fact that the stair lighting wasn't on meant a", " precarious trip up in the dark.  We entered to find no bedding and no toilet roll or any sort of bathroom amenities such as towels. Dalva offered to buy this from Sainsbury (at 9pm) - she then left to do so and then called to advise she couldn't buy it and would it be okay to deliver the next day. We took the initiative and went to a friend's house to borrow bedding.  On check out (Sunday morning), I returned the bedding and Dalva was due to meet us for the keys back - instead we were met by a 3rd guy; he was 'authorised' to give me \u00a340 back for the inconvenience of finding our own bedding and the taxi costs.

I'm not slating the personalities of the people who run this little venture.  I'm sure they want to make a tidy profit but for starters, bedding is paramount when you rent out a room!! Toilet roll is one of these small considerations you need to think about too.  No-one wanted ownership for it and I was glad to check out in the end.

It was a guest house so it felt quite nice and homely and was cleaner than you would expect a private company's hotel room to be like (but not as thoroughly clean as bigger branched hotels).

FREE WIFI that is of good speed! Check-out time was not strict as you could just put the keys through the letter box at the end of your stay.

The upstairs toilet was difficult to flush. The shower cubicle filled up with water around your feet quickly.

We've been staying here for several weeks so I feel I know the place pretty well now. Anyway: what we have is a dining/living room and kitchen downstairs, and a bathroom, full size bedroom and half bedroom upstairs. There are closets in both bedrooms but only one closet has a clothes rail.   Overall, these small flats really suffer from a lack of TLC. When we moved in, the dishwasher didn't work, the washing machine was on its last legs and most of the lights in the living room were kaput. I don't know if it's because our booking was through a big company, or if Bridgestreet are just very good, but we got all these niggles fixed within days - dishwasher repaired, new washing machine installed and a man to fix all the", " bust bulbs, lamps and blown fuses.   We wanted a bed side light on either side of the bed (there was only one - broken - which was replaced) and we moved a working one from the living room. Then we had to move the bed because the cables wouldn't reach and we thought the bed was going to collapse! (A man came later with an extension cord.) The bed itself is relatively comfortable although the pillows are old and hard.   When you come into the hall (there is just one lock on the rather flimsy front door) you are confronted with what was once a white carpet that is now extremely grimy and very unattractive. (This needs replacing and the whole place is crying out to be repainted.) However, we found the entire flat to be extremely clean despite the grimy appearance of the stained carpet, rugs and sad old couch. You are also met with a slightly sweet, sort of rotten smell when you come in. We think this is caused by literally years of the shower leaking from the bath and rotting the wooden skirting boards in the bathroom. I think this probably happens in all the bathrooms as you see the water stains on the ceiling all along the corridor outside the flats.  This place is advertised as a serviced apartment. Americans and maybe others would be in for a shock because here all that means is someone comes round and cleans once a week. If you want kitchen towel, toilet paper, dishwashing tablets, laundry stuff - yeah you have to buy all this yourself. So it's not serviced at all in the usually understood term. There is no chopping board and a slightly random selection of utensils in the kitchen. We had to ask for a teatowel and some oven gloves as there was nothing like that here.   We have found the flats to be extremely warm - after all they are on the top floors and heat rises. In November we have not had the heating on once, and sleep with the windows wide open at night. It's not always quiet, there is a loud pub nearby where people congregate to shout and scream into the wee hours, and a huge building site next door. They are demolishing the top two stories to renovate them and often start work at 4am! So, very noisy.   Are these flats secure and safe? Well, if you look at the entrance on google street view, you will see all the rough sleepers huddled around the entrance. You get in through this door with a code and up in the lift to the 14th floor. We always wait before we come up to hear the door lock behind us so no one can follow us in. There are often street drinkers and homeless people hanging around but we haven't had any problems. At night we always put a wedge under our flat door just in case. This morning my husband went out and found someone had propped the downstairs entrance open - you have to be vigilant really, as mentioned the flat doors are flimsy with only one small lock. But so far so good.  Last but not least, the flats are called Panoramic Heights for a reason - yes, the views over London are really amazing! You are also situated in a fantastic area of London and can walk anywhere and everywhere. We have loved staying here. That said, I can't wait to move somewhere that feels a little less insecure and is more comfortable and cleaner looking.   So if you don't care too much about the appearance of things but would appreciate the location and the views, this place would be great for a short trip or place for a small family to stay with more facilities and less cost than a central London hotel.", "\u2026", "I stayed at the new Panoramic Heights for 4 nights early December 2006, having been unable to get into one of their other properties, Kings Wardrobe. It is one of the Bridgestreet Worldwide Serviced apartment buildings (self-catering) , and is its newest in London (as at writing). Price paid was \u00a3125 + VAT per night.  Unfortunately, whilst the newness is good in that you feel that you're walking into a new apartment, some parts aren't finished - the Flat I was in (a single bed one, flat 5) had loose wiring coming from the bedroom wall heater instead of being wired to the mains!  The corridors outside the flats on the 14 floor also feel incomplete (some bits seem to be awaiting carpet?)  I was also concerned about privacy and safety.  LOCATION  The apartments are on the top", " (14th) floor of the Travelodge near the top of Drury Lane. Not the one at the corner of Drury Lane/Holborn, but the one accross the road (there are 2 on opposite sides of Holborn).   However, the entrance is off a back street, opposite what seems to be a nightclub/bar entrance - not via the Travelodge entrance, and (I am no shrinking violet) I didn't feel very safe. The first night , as I went in the bulilding, 2 policemen were stopping and searching a guy near the entrance! Access is via a keycode panel that leads straight to the lift. Unfortunately the lift also seemed to be on the blink a bit - every time I was in it, it was dialling the emergency  number (as if someone had pressed the emergency button), but bizarrely couldn't get through - \"The number you have dialled has not been recognised.....\". Not very reassuring !  Otherwise, its pretty close to Covent Garden (10 mins walk). There's also a Sainsbury's 5 minutes up Holborn towards the city for your food shopping. Its about 30-40 minutes walk to the City if you're staying for business.  A big bummer is that you have to collect your keys from another site - the King's Wardrobe (down near St Paul's - ie a long way away! A good 30 mins + walk or a cab ride!). There is no reception, or even security desk at the property itself.  ACCOMODATION  The inside of the apartments is pretty good. All nice, shiny and new at the moment - even the pans !   The apartments are duplex, meaning that they feel very spacious. Entrance downstairs leads into the living area, complete with TV, DVD and CD player/radio. Comfy sofa and table/chairs. Off this is the kitchen, which is extremely well set up with fridge, microwave, dishwasher (with 2 tablets provided) and hob (no full oven), plus a washer/dryer.  The company sets you up with a small welcome pack to get you started (longlife milk etc), but you'll pretty quickly want to find some proper food if you're staying for a while. Also - no washing powder for the washing machine or washing up liquid (they expect you to use the dishwasher).  Upstairs is the bedroom/bathroom(s).  The bed was fantastic, but again, probably because it was new, and the matress/pillows/linen was still in good nick. The bedroom itself was very spacious, and en suite. There was (curiously) also a second bathroom with a bath, which for a 1 bed apartment felt a bit redundant.  On both levels, there is a balcony with a door access (locked by what seems to be a very simple lock), BUT this is a shared  balcony which runs the length of the building - no screens or dividers. In other words, anyone can be walking along it. As the sides of your apartment (on both levels) are predominently windows, (with blinds not curtains), this doesn't feel very private. I felt a bit nervous walking round in boxers in the living area, because the blinds in the living area are so thin you can see through them. Also, the balconies both seemed to collect massive lakes of water when it rained, which meant that they were unusable anyway even though they were covered - unless you'd packed the wellies. So I didn't see much of the vaunted \"panoramic\" view of London.  It was also slightly disturbing that I didn't see anyone else whilst I was staying there, which made the nights I arrived back after 11 pm feel pretty strange. That may be appealing to some though.  OVERALL ?  It did the job for business for me.  It was cheaper than most city hotels, but I did have a fair walk every day into the City (Taxi's hard to come by at peak work times, and no reception to book one for you).  However, as comfy as it was inside, I wouldn't want my wife staying here (especially alone) - it just didn't feel right.  My advice would be to find somewhere nicer.  Incidentally, I have left my comments for Bridgestreet, so I'm interested to see if they respond or improve the odder aspects of this property.

I would not have taken the apartment had I not arrived after an exhausting journey and had family coming to join me.  I arrived on a Saturday when there was no customer service agent available.  The maintenance chap was extremely helpful and had the cleaning manager come out to offer me a different apartment, which was not much better but less smelly.  I was going to stick it out until Monday in the hope that an apartment befitting g the description of luxury was available but when a construction crew started to set up outside at 6.30am on Sunday and was", " working all day, that was the last straw.  I bailed and thank goodness I had booked with my Amex. I lodged a dispute and received a full refund.  I will say that the staff I dealt with throughout the ordeal where all very courteous and helpful. I have never been contacted by a customer service representative to address my dissatisfaction.  The person that handled my booking did apologise and I sent photos for him to forward to the manager but I've not heard back.    If you think about dismissing this review in favour of the good reviews (those reviewers must have stayed in a different building) then do yourself a favour and use a payment method that gives you the option to stop payment when you find yourself in one of the apartments I was unfortunate enough to be placed in. I wanted to paste in some photos but the link won't allow it.", "\u2026", "Stayed in The Courtyard Wimbledon whilst on business, the apartment was clean, spacious with fantastically fluffy towels and large comfy sofas. The kitchen was very well equipped. I was provided with a space in the secure underground car park and broadband access at no extra cost.

Wimbledon also provides a wide variety of restaurants catering for many international tastes.  The apartment itself, is all you could wish for in a home away from home.

On the positive side, the is Apartment is centrally located, 5mins walk from Tower Hill tube station and DLR line. There is also a Tesco Express opposite and a Sainsbury's local 2 mins away. The Apartment has got two bedrooms. The master bedroom is a good size with a double bed and bathroom. On the negative side, the second bedroom is tiny with a small double bed squashed inside, making it very claustrophobic and difficult to shut the bedroom door. There was also no space to put up the travel cot, so my baby ended up sleeping in the living room, which is far from ideal. The second bathroom is also a good size with a bath & shower. The kitchen is small but perfectly", " functional.   When I returned from my holiday, I received an email from the booking agent Central London Apartments informing me that my credit card and personal information had been stolen from their database. I immediately contacted my bank, but unfortunately a large sum of money had already been stolen. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia have been fantastic with helping me get the money back, but I have had to cancel all my cards and this means reorganising all my banking info including direct debits etc. I have also started to receive dodgy emails and telephone calls from shady eastern european companies requesting my banking information. This might be a coincidence, but as a precaution I have changed my mobile phone number and email address.    Therefore to sum up, I would recommend the Londinium Apartment as a good place to stay in a central London location, but I would advise anyone booking through Central London Apartments to exercise extreme caution when giving them credit card and personal information. My advise would be to try and pay cash or failing that, pay by credit card and then immediately cancel the card and get a new one issued. There is nothing worse than returning from holiday to find out you have been scammed. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else....", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "231", "attractions_nearby": "57", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["Cafe", "Italian", "Mediterranean", "European"]},

Al llegar avisamos por tel\u00e9fono a la due\u00f1a y a pesar de llegar bastante antes de la hora del check in, pudimos ocupar la habitaci\u00f3n para dejar las maletas y empezar a preparar la visita a Londres.

A\u00fan as\u00ed hay sitio para dejar las maletas debajo de la cama, varias repisas y estanter\u00edas y un peque\u00f1o armario donde dejar abrigos y ropa. Hay hervidor de agua con infusiones, caf\u00e9, vasos, tazas y un adaptador de enchufe. En el ba\u00f1o no hay enchufe, pero hay uno pr\u00f3ximo a la puerta de entrada por lo que con un cable normal puedes usar el secador, maquina de afeitar u otros aparatos que puedas necesitar, aunque hay que tener la puerta abierta.

La habitaci\u00f3n cuenta tambi\u00e9n con una peque\u00f1a nevera donde puedes tener fruta, leche, bebidas, ensaladas u otros productos que utilices. Las camas son c\u00f3modas, aunque como es t\u00edpico en Inglaterra, la habitaci\u00f3n no dispone de persianas y las cortinas apenas tapan la luz, por lo que entra luz en la habitaci\u00f3n tanto de las farolas como al amanecer. La calle no es especialmente ruidosa, pero si se oyen los coches pasar y si pasan ambulancias o similares pueden despertarte si tienes el sue\u00f1o ligero.

El pago del desayuno es en efectivo, no disponen de terminal para pago con tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito, cosa a tener en cuenta. Por 5\u00a3 por persona merece mucho la pena cogerlo, salvo que no te cuadre por los horarios. Nosotros el \u00faltimo d\u00eda no lo cogimos por salir el vuelo muy temprano, pero el resto de d\u00edas nos vino muy bien para empezar el d\u00eda con energ\u00eda para recorrer Londres.

The 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment itself was in updated condition and very nicely appointed, with a kitchen that had a dishwasher and combo washer/dryer.  We arrived on a Saturday, and the first two nights were fine until Monday night. I had no idea that the apartments are right over a bar/nightclub, which is closed on the weekend (in general, The City is pretty dead on Saturday and Sunday) but open literally all night during the week. We listened to excruiatingly loud club music until about 2 in the", " morning Monday through Friday night (how these people go to work the next morning is beyond me; maybe I'm getting old). Since we were on the second floor, the bar was immediately below us and was probably worse than had we been up on a higher floor (though it was so loud I don't know if it would have mattered). Also, although the address is St. John's Street, it's little more than an alley. The main street on the other side is the Minories, which is a much busier street (though the traffic noise was much more welcome than the insanely loud club music). The kids took forever to fall asleep; I don't think I slept at all. But then, I am a light sleeper.  So if you have kids or like to get any amount of sleep at all during the week, I wouldn't recommend this property (note to self; ask if the apartment is above or near a bar the next time when booking in London).

We stayed in 2019 in a beautiful Sonder apartment in Covent Garden, and we did tons of research on apartments and locations. Our family loved the location, and the apartment was perfect in every aspect so we had to go back in 2020 in February. Our family was very fortunate to find a fantastic unit this time in the museum house, it was 1/2 the price of the covent garden unit we rented the previous year and it was larger but just as nice.

The keyless entry is also a huge upgrade!  Really look forward to Sonder next time I\u2019m in Londontown.", "I really wanted to like Sonder Museum House, based on all the reviews that I read. It could be that I had a one off bad experience, but here's my take on it. First, the good. The apartment was exactly as pictured and very spacious, sleek, and modern. Thoughtful touches like detergent pods, a new sponge, and olive oil packets were available. The less ideal parts: customer service is through texting only (no big deal if your stay goes smoothly, but this is a huge pain when you need assistance). My first day there, the bathroom had a musty/moldy smell, so I was worried there was a pipe issue -- I had a back and forth texting conversation for hours with Sonder staff who kept telling me someone would come check it out and then they didn't. Instead, they moved me to a separate", " apartment in the building which was nice. My second evening there, I realized around 9pm that there was no hot water for the shower and again ended up in a back and forth conversation until midnight, which was inefficient. Finally, they found another apartment to put me in, but once I got to the automatic keybox, there was no key. Then they shifted me into another apartment on my floor that also had no hot water... They told me to wait an hour for the hot water to come back, but it still didn't work. Then they moved me into yet another apartment so I could use the shower. After getting shuffled around so much, I decided to just cancel the rest of my week stay and get a refund... In summary, cute apartments but not worth the hassle of dealing with such a disorganized and inefficient process (although the staff members were nice)", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "466", "attractions_nearby": "169", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["Cafe", "Seafood", "Cafe", "Italian"]},

Location-to actually get into London you need to get at least two trains (overground) before you can even get to an underground station to then get around London. Might not seem like a big deal but being that far out as a tourist isn\u2019t ideal. The station itself is relatively close but not a nice walk in the dark, you have to walk down an alleyway and over a bridge full of mattresses.

The location is very convenient (near the Hyde Park) but still not too noisy as it's located in a side street without traffic in front of the building. Nevertheless, there was some noise: the walls are so thin that I could actually hear the people next door watching TV and snoring. The room I stayed in was rather small but enough big for 2 nights. It seems to me that the heating system is a bit tricky: My room on the ground floor was comfortably warm while me colleague's room on the upper floor was too warm (couldn't be turned dowm by herself in the room).

On settling in was really pleased; storage for bits & pieces, plugs in actually useful places, sparklingly clean and with fans and desk lamp provided.  I was out for most of the days I was in London but it was a great base. So close to North Acton tube stop and therefore easy to get around. There is also a communal kitchen shared with 4 other rooms. I didnt see anyone else other than my friend, and the kitchen was stocked with tea/coffee/milk and again immaculately clean.

The rooms were surprisingly cool overnight, which was welcome in the searing heat! My experience with high rise accommodation in the past is that they do struggle to stay cool. But despite the windows having restricted openings (I was on the 18th floor - so fair enough) it was cool enough to not need the fan overnight.  The beds were comfy too with duvet & 2 pillows provided.  The bathroom was functional and again practical with storage. Good shower, and really clean!  Only slight criticism is that the towels were a little small, but that maybe due to my increasing waistline...  Highly, highly recommend.
