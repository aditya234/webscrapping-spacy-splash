I operate a world-renowned jazz history website, and I have travelled extensively to write about this music. I thought it would be a good gesture to stay in a hostel named for my favorite music. Bad idea. In fact, I think jazz should sue for libel! When I made my reservation, I was supposed to cover a nightclub appearance by a well-known jazz artist. Unfortunately, the club  was unwilling to provide press tickets. I called the hostel to cancel or reschedule my reservation, and they refused to do either. They had collected all of my money upfront and had no intention of returning it! I made several attempts to negotiate with the \"customer service agents\" until I finally decided to fulfill the commitment and then be done with it. When I arrived, things got worse.", " For the first and ONLY time in my history of staying in hostels, I was told the facility does not provide bath towels. After I raised a fuss, the clerk finally gave me one...acting like he was doing me a favor. The bed had one fitted sheet and a flat sheet folded up on the bed. I didn't even bother to make the bed. I came back to the hostel late in the evening to discover that none of the lights worked in my room. I waited for nearly half an hour to get the clerk to come up to my room and fix the problem. He fumbled around and found one solution, but never figured out how to get any of the other bulbs to light. The coup de grace came the  following morning. After a rather restless night, there was no hot water for the private shower I paid for! I couldn't get out of there fast enough! NEVER AGAIN!!!", "\u2026", "If your reading this review, spend that tiny bit extra on a better room somewhere else. It may be a cheap option but if a prison cell feels homely for you then go ahead.

We where here for work and didn\u2019t want to ball out on a room but had to leave to stay elsewhere for a night, we couldn\u2019t sleep as the doors baby extremely loud and you can hear the conversation of people in the next room. The cleaning ladies where extremely loud in the day making it impossible to get sleep night or day.

The way we came in, there wasn't really anywhere to park so I didn't get to walk in with him during check in (which was fine, no rush). I'm a super introvert & not very comfortable in new places including that it looked very sophisticated from the outside looking in (mind you I wasn't wearing my best outfit & my messy hair was saved by my favorite hat). Walking inside everything was breath taking... From the front desk, waiting area, dining area ect... Had a little awkward moment with a front desk employee when I didn't notice another customer walking from the side of me  Front desk (To customer besides me) : Welcome Back! Me (Walking", " inside for the very first time) : Hello :) *Face palm* Entering the elevator was pretty mindblowing to me since the most buttons I've ever seen my whole life only went up to 10 floors instead there were about (excuse me if I'm wrong) 30 floors!  My room was on the 22nd floor, finding my room was very easy (the number starts off as the floor number you're on & then your room number). The key was really fun to use to open the door, would even find something small to do to walk out & use it again.  Now walking inside the room was a feeling I wish to never forget! Words cannot describe how beautiful the room was, especially the view. I usually take photos but ended up making a video wanting to re-live every moment, every step. The door to the bathroom was a sliding door (it was alittle tough to get grab on to close it, but when I did it slided effortlessly). Every light on the bathroom mirror worked, nice & bright felt like I was in a photo shoot. Not a stain anywhere to be found. In conclusion, my stay was amazing & when I visit again... I would love to stay at this hotel again.

They did bring me another one, but still no bedsheet.  I'm still a bit dumbfounded not knowing what to do since I have another night stay here tomorrow. Should I go somewhere else?

Easy walk to sites in Wall st area.", "Good afternoon:  I will like to take this opportunity and express of what could me resolve in a better way but it was turn into a dissatisfaction and disappointment. I am was traveling with husband and we were going to stop in New York City for a night and we decide it to book one night in your facility. The reason why we pick the Marriott is because my mother in law is current working in one of your hotels and my husband is a former employee. We have a family emergency last night on Wednesday April 3, 2019 and I proceed to go to the Marriott application and cancel our reservation because we knew it was going to be imposible to make it on the day of the reservation that it was on Thursday April 4,2019 to Friday April 5,2019. Just to make sure, I logged back into the application", " and it was saying in a message.... we can\u2019t find your application please contact the reservation center. I placed a called and the person told me the application is cancel. I ask the gentleman on the phone to make sure everything is cancel because of my emergency and he told me everything is cancel. The next day I was checking my email because I know or usually is a email sent with the information of the cancellation but it was not. Process to placed a call at 1:35 pm to the hotel to verify everything was cancel. Here is went the problem beginning, a young lady answer my called and I was explaining everything to her but I was constantly Interrupted by her and for some reason she was not letting me explain the situation and all she was telling me is that is nothing she can do and I was going to get change me staying or not. I\u2019m going to be really honest and saying that in all my years of experience with customer services, never experienced such a bad customer services. Trust me went I tell you that I do understand your policies and procedures because every company established guidelines to follow and I completely understand that but is also important to listen to the customer and try to get other solution to the issue or problem. She fail to ask me what was the problem or why I was not going to be able to make it to the reservation. Right there I knew she was not going to help me in any way and I felt disappointed. It one point into our conversation I ask to speak to the manager or supervisor and her response was... the supervisor is on the phone just give me a second and she processes to put me on hold. Picking back the phone she informed me that the supervisor told her is nothing we can do for you. I was in disbelief and how 2 people did not ask me what was the problem. How can you have employee working in this type of industry went you have to be working with people and the most important thing is customer service. Again, I understand your policies but I believe in solution to easy the situation and not excalete into this point. The way the person on the phone was speaking to me was not pleasant and she was over and under talking and not listening to me at all. In one point into the conversation I told her that she need it to listen me and let me talk first and then she can say whatever she need it to explain or say to me. All this Could it be avoided if the person on the phone was polite and listen to what I was saying and try to find a solution to my situation. I hope that you can coach this person to be an understanding person and to do a better customer service.  Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope this person learn a leassion and not continue this behavior.", "\u2026", "This was my first time visiting New York for a casual trip.

Cost $1050 in total for the week, with no tax. Had to pay upfront, and as another reviewer has pointed out, once you have done this there is no comeback.

The studio appt was shabby: the bathroom was mildewy, the bathroom cabinet was dirty, inadequate space, hangers for (very thin cheap) towels.

Very offputting we did not use these facilities.  I would not care to stay in this appt in the winter as I do not believe it would be warm enough nor the summer as it had no air con.  All the electrical sockets were loose from the wall as well. Bed was ok thank god.    We smelled gas and being worried we turned off the (ancient) stove at the mains.  The gas smell went. I called up about this and was casually told that the pilot light must have gone out and needed to be relit. Why were there no instructions on this point which clearly was potentially hazardous!    In general the whole appt could have done with a major overhaul but clearly the inappropriately named Hospitality Co do not care about repeat business.  In addition the location is very noisy on thursday/fri weekend nights with people below, until at least 3pm, so if quiet is important to you do not get an appt facing onto Bleecker St!  A pity because this is good value and clearly you do not expect 5* facilities but at least you expect the room to be clean and appliances safe.

We especially like places with a historic or architectural uniqueness. In all of these senses and more, House of the Redeemer is a gem.  Located half a block from Central Park West (Fifth Ave.), it's an easy stroll to the Guggenheim, the Met, the Jewish Museum, the Neue Gallery, the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, and other cultural landmarks.

This was my third stay, and the first time I stayed there in the summer. It's a beautiful house in the pleasant Upper East Side, right near Central Park. For location, it gets an A+.  The first two floors are architecturally striking and have been used in movie and TV shoots. The library furnishings, 17th-century Italian, were brought to New York during World War I. The chapel is also lovely. It is fun perusing these rooms.  Guest rooms are on the third and fourth floors. All are very simple, though there is evidence that furnishings are being upgraded as possible. Our room with private bath had updated shower, tiles, and toilet, and we did not have a problem with hot water, though we had", " to wait for it from time to time. But be clear--these are not luxury accommodations! Fourth-floor rooms are smaller than those on the third.  Our room had air conditioning (not all guest rooms do), which worked only modestly well but definitely helped in the NYC summer. Those who prefer full-blast cooling would do better to stay here at a different time of year.  This is a quiet place with two daily chapel services and a schedule of spiritual retreats. People who enjoy this type of atmosphere and simple accommodations will like it. There are plenty of good restaurants, coffee shops, and museums nearby, so self-indulgence and entertainment are right there if you need them.  My overall impression: This house is being managed, as well as possible with an older house in need of constant TLC, in a way that honors the intentions of the Vanderbilt descendant who donated it. She wished to create \"a place apart\" for spiritual retreat. I respect the management for following this to a T, even if it means older furniture, staffing kept to a minimum, and so forth. They clearly value the austere beauty of this place and wish to offer a quiet time away to the people who seek it out.", "\u2026", "The House of the Redeemer is a small, four story, turn of the last century townhouse done in an Italian style, where you can imagine Edith Wharton paying a visit. Inside in the public rooms, it is as if time stopped.  The library and other rooms are available for receptions and concerts. They are grand and museum quality. (I did not get to photograph them as they were dark when I was there.) It is a great setting for a gathering of any sort. But even though the House of the Redeemer is now popping up as specialty housing on all the tourist websites, it should not be viewed as a tourist hotel or \u201ccheap digs.\u201d It bills itself as \u201ca place apart, a place where all may find spiritual refreshment in their visit.\u201d  They encourage guests to see it as a place to study, to attend their", " retreats; chapel services are available twice daily. However they do accept some overnight guests as capacity allows and it can be a safe, adequate place to stay if you do not need a hotel with all the staff and services and have low comfort requirements.   I was surprised actually to see this facility listed on Tripadvisor, but without any reviews. As someone who has stayed there a few times, I will share some notes.  Guest Rooms- the rooms are small and basic. They were probably maids rooms at one time and still have the same furnishings. No clocks or extra lighting. You get a bed, a dresser and linens and a fan in summer. Unlike the some of the furniture, the sheets and towels were in good shape. Mattress springs noisy but otherwise comfortable. A little bar of soap is provided but bring your own shampoo and lotion. If you want to relax, there is a lounge area with sofas and reading materials, although it is a rather dark, windowless  room. There is also a small kitchen. There are some en-suite bathrooms which I have never seen. Most rooms share several modest hallway bathrooms.  Maintenance- as noted, it is as if time stood still. Well, the plumbing is not from 1914 but it probably dates mid 20th century. The handbook says that you may need to wait as long as ten minutes for hot water, but in my experience sometimes it never shows up. Both showers on the fourth floor need new washers in their faucets so even if there is hot water in the sink, accessing it in the shower can be a challenge.  Cleanliness-a couple of the shared bathrooms had a very funky odor about them, most likely from plumbing venting (or the lack of) rather than cleanliness. They were well cleaned. My room this visit had not been vacuumed for my arrival. The common areas however looked ok.  Heat and A/C- the website says all rooms are air conditioned but I think what they mean is that the receptions rooms on the first and second floor are air conditioned. Only some of the guest rooms have air conditioners. Fans are available.  New York City in the summer months (June- Sept) without an A/C can be very uncomfortable, so I would not even consider staying there in that time period. in the winter you need to open or close the window to raise or lower the heat-there are no thermostats.   Checking in and assistance- there is no desk clerk nor concierge. There is a receptionist with regular office hours. Quite frequently you are asked to check in before 5 pm. I do not think they are open weekends. You must ask about check in time or you will be left standing on the street with no recourse. The receptionist will ask you to pay on check in. A credit card is accepted.  You are on your own getting your luggage up the steps into the building, but there is an elevator to the guest room floors. It is rather small, old and rickety so if you usually avoid elevators in favor of the stairs, do realize it is a long steep climb up many flights of narrow stairs.  In summary, if you need lots of hot water, or lots of advice to getting around the city, or want room service, or just the right amount of heat or AC- find a real hotel.

This review is a correction.    My original problem was that the property charged the advance to my credit card (as agreed), but then didn't answer phone or email for a month.  So I figured it for a scam and bailed.  Then finally Philip did contact me and explained they were on vacation, the staff lost my many phone calls and emails, etc. etc and he'd only discovered my complaint because of my review here on TripAdvisor (!).  Philip enticed me to give it a try FOR FREE to make up for my distress.  So I did and here's my review.    The property DOES exist and is not a scam after all, whew.  It's at 59 E80th, which is the #1 advantage of this rental -- superb location, as another reviewer pointed out  ", " The price is $250-350ish which is not bad by NYC standards, not bad at all for a studio on the Upper East side.  The rooms have been recently refurbished and are fancy and nice: gleaming wood floors, and in the more expensive King room that we had, plenty of space (except see about the bathroom below).  There's still some refurbishing to be done, the closets are wonky, but overall the place is very nice, especially for Manhattan.  The bathroom is really, really small.  I think they cut a real bathroom in 1/4 and 3/4, then used the 1/4 for the bathroom and the other 3/4 for the kitchen.  If you are thin (maybe the lack of space is why so many New Yorkers are so thin? :-) the bathroom might be fine, but if you are a hefty American it might be impossible for you to function in there.  It worked ok for my wife and me.    Negative #1: the service is sadly poor.  Philip is a great guy, very nice, but he's so busy with his life that you never see him.  Of course this is a studio not a hotel, so you shouldn't need much service.  But we ran out of towels regularly (we do use a lot), and the cause of all my initial heartache was the poor phone and email communication.  Even after the incident, one of my fellow attendees had to cancel their reservation and had distress (multiple emails and eventually needed to get me involved to get through) getting an email confirmation from Philip.  So it wasn't just a one time thing -- Philip and crew really are just bad at email and phone.  You know how some people just don't respond to email and phone quickly, or sometimes at all?   It's not a crime, it's like a pre-electronic-culture thing.  I think it is bad in a business.   Negative #2: the building next door, and by \"next door\" in NYC I mean it literally shared a wall with my room, was under construction, and the workers tell me it will remain under construction until late 2009.  So, from 8am-3:30pm weekdays there are occasional jackhammers, talking, etc.  The workmen are nice and try to keep it down, and the noise is only intermittent and somewhat muffled.  Furthermore, Philip did warn us of this so it wasn't a shock.  Still, it was annoying, so be prepared if you want to sleep after 8am.      Small negative #3: the heat is not very controllable.  We found it cold but Philip said if he turned on the building heat that early in the year it'd probably be too warm.  So we settled for cold and bundled up a bit.    Bottom line: if you don't mind poor phone contact and service, don't need a standard American-sized bathroom, and you don't mind some noise during the weekdays, this is a good deal, nice digs, and a really excellent location.  It was delightful to step out of the building and be in an upscale neighborhood just a couple blocks from Park Ave, the Met, and 5 short blocks to the subway.  I gave them an extra star because my rooms were free to make up for the trouble, and I'd thought the price reasonable to begin with.  What's not to like about that?  All in all, my wife and I had a great time, and would stay here again -- after the construction next door is completed.", "\u2026", "We went to NYC on holidays, to meet up with some old friends. They live on Upper East Side and we wanted to find accommodation close by. I soon discovered that finding a decent priced hotel nearby would be quite a challenge, so I tried to find alternative accommodations online. I came across Anco Studios and sent them an email. Based on the information on their websites, it seemed OK, but I was nevertheless a bit worried about it all as I, at the time, couldn\u2019t find any reviews of the place online. However, our decision to take a chance and book a studio with Anco Studios proved to be very good!

We arrived close to midnight, however it was no problem to check in and we hardly had to wait. Our room was located on the main floor in the back of the house which leaves it pretty dark for most of the day.

Bare in mind the people on reception and the manager of the apartments are different companies.  The manager of the apartments was not available when we wanted to speak to him and so we asked whoever we could find. At 2:03pm, the cleaner knocked on the door and asked when we were leaving. We explained that the man downstairs had given us 10 minutes grace to collect our clothing (some of which were tracksuit bottoms and two girls under 18 were in underwear in the room). She then nodded and proceeded to text the manager who came up two minutes later and knocked on the door again. He proceeded to shout and become very hostile and aggressive towards us. I tried to explain that we\u2019d been given ten minutes to allow us to put our clothes in from the dryer, but he started to push his way into the room whilst shouting, which is when I tried to close the door on him as the girls had to hide in the bathroom where they didn\u2019t have any clothes on their bottom halves. After five minutes of shouting at us we had no choice but to leave the room with the girls having towels wrapped around their waists for modesty. It was an absolute disgrace! We were able to get them dressed in the laundry room with a bit of privacy once their clothes had dried, and then went into the managers office to return the keys. Again he began shouting abuse at myself and other members of the party, saying that the guests who were checking into the room after us had requested an early check-in at 2:30pm, and he needed us out on time. He should not have taken $50 from us for a late check out and the same from them for the same room! Especially when we made sure it would be okay to leave ten minutes late because of the clothes being in the dryer!

Not was it not in the box where our key was supposed to be, and we just stood under the house for more than", " an hour and could not get into the paid room. As a result of a long correspondence with the administrators of the hostel, just a resident of the rooms opened the door of the hostel!!! Entering the room, we found that we were not given a magnetic key to the street door and the key to the front door, that is, if we leave the room to get back, we need to stand and wait for at least someone from this hostel!!! Because this is an ordinary residential building!!! When I wrote to the hostel administrators in the booking chat, they said \u2014 yes, there are no keys, but we will make it!!!! And when will you give it to us? I asked. To which they answered me \u2014 to try faster!!!! Can you imagine??? That is, I flew to New York for 2 weeks and it is not clear how many days I have to sit in the room and wait for the key???? We were waiting for at least some answer from the hotel administrators, but they just stopped responding to us!!!!!!! That is, at 12.30 at night we just sat and waited for at least some answer!!! In the end, my husband and I took the suitcase and left this awful place!!!!!!! But!!! These dishonest people did not return our security deposit!!!!!!!!!! We paid money booking \u2014 and this amount was returned to us by booking after we read all our correspondence and were just shocked by these deceivers. But according to the rules of this hostel, we had to send them a $ 200 security deposit!!! NEVER SEND like we did!!! And in the end, these cheaters accused us of stealing the towel from them!!!!!!!!!!! Can you imagine??? We flew across the world to steal a towel from this terrible hostel!!!!!!! And in the end they returned us $ 125!!!!!!! And $ 75 was just stolen from us!!! These are shameless, dishonest cheats, never contact this hostel!!! There are many wonderful places in New York, but not this!!! All correspondence, evidence I have in the booking!!!! Until this awful hotel returns for $ 75, which was simply dishonestly stolen from us, I will write wherever possible so that people do not contact this place!!!

My phone died and I forgot my charger and didn't mind being off the grid for a bit. The only problem is that I was going off the clock in the room which was two hours off.

We travel on a budget often and love to stay in hostels when we can. This seemed like the perfect location for us as it is a block away from Penn Station, in a great area(Chelsea), and is a cute place. There are just a couple things that I think people should be aware of before booking. When we first arrived for check in, we walked up the street and back before finding the building we believed was the one (there is now no tree out front so it confused us), then went up to the door and pressed the bell button (that they wound up changing to say Incentra Home while we were still staying here which is exactly what I would\u2019ve recommended as it was a bit confusing to locate). Once someone came to open the", " door, we were escorted to the first floor kitchen where the guy told us a few things like where the laundry room is located, check out protocol, and gave us the code for our room as well as the front door. We then payed the rest of the room fees and taxes and went up to our room on the third floor(Room 3E). The different floors follow different color themes and it is  a very cute and modern look. They definitely have updated the style and bathrooms to make it more modern and hip, which is very nice. I will say that our room did not meet the expectations set by the photos though. The halls and rooms seem to be pretty dark, and although we knew it would be a small room, we were surprised with how old and worn the room actually seemed. The main problem was the bed, it was pretty small(I believe a full size not queen which I don\u2019t believe I saw on the site) and the last door or two of the bed was at a complete slope downward. It was like we were sleeping on an old futon. Anyways, we did sleep pretty comfortably and the bathrooms were nice and spacious. The backyard has some furniture that is breaking down a bit but a nice place to go outside to eat or smoke. Also the kitchens are updated and useful if you have something you want to store in the refrigerators but they are smelly and there is A Lot of food stored in them that seems old.

The way we came in, there wasn't really anywhere to park so I didn't get to walk in with him during check in (which was fine, no rush). I'm a super introvert & not very comfortable in new places including that it looked very sophisticated from the outside looking in (mind you I wasn't wearing my best outfit & my messy hair was saved by my favorite hat). Walking inside everything was breath taking... From the front desk, waiting area, dining area ect... Had a little awkward moment with a front desk employee when I didn't notice another customer walking from the side of me  Front desk (To customer besides me) : Welcome Back! Me (Walking", " inside for the very first time) : Hello :) *Face palm* Entering the elevator was pretty mindblowing to me since the most buttons I've ever seen my whole life only went up to 10 floors instead there were about (excuse me if I'm wrong) 30 floors!  My room was on the 22nd floor, finding my room was very easy (the number starts off as the floor number you're on & then your room number). The key was really fun to use to open the door, would even find something small to do to walk out & use it again.  Now walking inside the room was a feeling I wish to never forget! Words cannot describe how beautiful the room was, especially the view. I usually take photos but ended up making a video wanting to re-live every moment, every step. The door to the bathroom was a sliding door (it was alittle tough to get grab on to close it, but when I did it slided effortlessly). Every light on the bathroom mirror worked, nice & bright felt like I was in a photo shoot. Not a stain anywhere to be found. In conclusion, my stay was amazing & when I visit again... I would love to stay at this hotel again.

They did bring me another one, but still no bedsheet.  I'm still a bit dumbfounded not knowing what to do since I have another night stay here tomorrow. Should I go somewhere else?

Easy walk to sites in Wall st area.", "Good afternoon:  I will like to take this opportunity and express of what could me resolve in a better way but it was turn into a dissatisfaction and disappointment. I am was traveling with husband and we were going to stop in New York City for a night and we decide it to book one night in your facility. The reason why we pick the Marriott is because my mother in law is current working in one of your hotels and my husband is a former employee. We have a family emergency last night on Wednesday April 3, 2019 and I proceed to go to the Marriott application and cancel our reservation because we knew it was going to be imposible to make it on the day of the reservation that it was on Thursday April 4,2019 to Friday April 5,2019. Just to make sure, I logged back into the application", " and it was saying in a message.... we can\u2019t find your application please contact the reservation center. I placed a called and the person told me the application is cancel. I ask the gentleman on the phone to make sure everything is cancel because of my emergency and he told me everything is cancel. The next day I was checking my email because I know or usually is a email sent with the information of the cancellation but it was not. Process to placed a call at 1:35 pm to the hotel to verify everything was cancel. Here is went the problem beginning, a young lady answer my called and I was explaining everything to her but I was constantly Interrupted by her and for some reason she was not letting me explain the situation and all she was telling me is that is nothing she can do and I was going to get change me staying or not. I\u2019m going to be really honest and saying that in all my years of experience with customer services, never experienced such a bad customer services. Trust me went I tell you that I do understand your policies and procedures because every company established guidelines to follow and I completely understand that but is also important to listen to the customer and try to get other solution to the issue or problem. She fail to ask me what was the problem or why I was not going to be able to make it to the reservation. Right there I knew she was not going to help me in any way and I felt disappointed. It one point into our conversation I ask to speak to the manager or supervisor and her response was... the supervisor is on the phone just give me a second and she processes to put me on hold. Picking back the phone she informed me that the supervisor told her is nothing we can do for you. I was in disbelief and how 2 people did not ask me what was the problem. How can you have employee working in this type of industry went you have to be working with people and the most important thing is customer service. Again, I understand your policies but I believe in solution to easy the situation and not excalete into this point. The way the person on the phone was speaking to me was not pleasant and she was over and under talking and not listening to me at all. In one point into the conversation I told her that she need it to listen me and let me talk first and then she can say whatever she need it to explain or say to me. All this Could it be avoided if the person on the phone was polite and listen to what I was saying and try to find a solution to my situation. I hope that you can coach this person to be an understanding person and to do a better customer service.  Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope this person learn a leassion and not continue this behavior.", "\u2026", "This was my first time visiting New York for a casual trip.

Cost $1050 in total for the week, with no tax. Had to pay upfront, and as another reviewer has pointed out, once you have done this there is no comeback.

I called up about this and was casually told that the pilot light must have gone out and needed to be relit. Why were there no instructions on this point which clearly was potentially hazardous!    In general the whole appt could have done with a major overhaul but clearly the inappropriately named Hospitality Co do not care about repeat business.  In addition the location is very noisy on thursday/fri weekend nights with people below, until at least 3pm, so if quiet is important to you do not get an appt facing onto Bleecker St!

Located half a block from Central Park West (Fifth Ave.), it's an easy stroll to the Guggenheim, the Met, the Jewish Museum, the Neue Gallery, the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, and other cultural landmarks.

This was my third stay, and the first time I stayed there in the summer. It's a beautiful house in the pleasant Upper East Side, right near Central Park. For location, it gets an A+.  The first two floors are architecturally striking and have been used in movie and TV shoots. The library furnishings, 17th-century Italian, were brought to New York during World War I. The chapel is also lovely. It is fun perusing these rooms.  Guest rooms are on the third and fourth floors. All are very simple, though there is evidence that furnishings are being upgraded as possible. Our room with private bath had updated shower, tiles, and toilet, and we did not have a problem with hot water, though we had", " to wait for it from time to time. But be clear--these are not luxury accommodations! Fourth-floor rooms are smaller than those on the third.  Our room had air conditioning (not all guest rooms do), which worked only modestly well but definitely helped in the NYC summer. Those who prefer full-blast cooling would do better to stay here at a different time of year.  This is a quiet place with two daily chapel services and a schedule of spiritual retreats. People who enjoy this type of atmosphere and simple accommodations will like it. There are plenty of good restaurants, coffee shops, and museums nearby, so self-indulgence and entertainment are right there if you need them.  My overall impression: This house is being managed, as well as possible with an older house in need of constant TLC, in a way that honors the intentions of the Vanderbilt descendant who donated it. She wished to create \"a place apart\" for spiritual retreat. I respect the management for following this to a T, even if it means older furniture, staffing kept to a minimum, and so forth. They clearly value the austere beauty of this place and wish to offer a quiet time away to the people who seek it out.", "\u2026", "The House of the Redeemer is a small, four story, turn of the last century townhouse done in an Italian style, where you can imagine Edith Wharton paying a visit. Inside in the public rooms, it is as if time stopped.  The library and other rooms are available for receptions and concerts. They are grand and museum quality. (I did not get to photograph them as they were dark when I was there.) It is a great setting for a gathering of any sort. But even though the House of the Redeemer is now popping up as specialty housing on all the tourist websites, it should not be viewed as a tourist hotel or \u201ccheap digs.\u201d It bills itself as \u201ca place apart, a place where all may find spiritual refreshment in their visit.\u201d  They encourage guests to see it as a place to study, to attend their", " retreats; chapel services are available twice daily. However they do accept some overnight guests as capacity allows and it can be a safe, adequate place to stay if you do not need a hotel with all the staff and services and have low comfort requirements.   I was surprised actually to see this facility listed on Tripadvisor, but without any reviews. As someone who has stayed there a few times, I will share some notes.  Guest Rooms- the rooms are small and basic. They were probably maids rooms at one time and still have the same furnishings. No clocks or extra lighting. You get a bed, a dresser and linens and a fan in summer. Unlike the some of the furniture, the sheets and towels were in good shape. Mattress springs noisy but otherwise comfortable. A little bar of soap is provided but bring your own shampoo and lotion. If you want to relax, there is a lounge area with sofas and reading materials, although it is a rather dark, windowless  room. There is also a small kitchen. There are some en-suite bathrooms which I have never seen. Most rooms share several modest hallway bathrooms.  Maintenance- as noted, it is as if time stood still. Well, the plumbing is not from 1914 but it probably dates mid 20th century. The handbook says that you may need to wait as long as ten minutes for hot water, but in my experience sometimes it never shows up. Both showers on the fourth floor need new washers in their faucets so even if there is hot water in the sink, accessing it in the shower can be a challenge.  Cleanliness-a couple of the shared bathrooms had a very funky odor about them, most likely from plumbing venting (or the lack of) rather than cleanliness. They were well cleaned. My room this visit had not been vacuumed for my arrival. The common areas however looked ok.  Heat and A/C- the website says all rooms are air conditioned but I think what they mean is that the receptions rooms on the first and second floor are air conditioned. Only some of the guest rooms have air conditioners. Fans are available.  New York City in the summer months (June- Sept) without an A/C can be very uncomfortable, so I would not even consider staying there in that time period. in the winter you need to open or close the window to raise or lower the heat-there are no thermostats.   Checking in and assistance- there is no desk clerk nor concierge. There is a receptionist with regular office hours. Quite frequently you are asked to check in before 5 pm. I do not think they are open weekends. You must ask about check in time or you will be left standing on the street with no recourse. The receptionist will ask you to pay on check in. A credit card is accepted.  You are on your own getting your luggage up the steps into the building, but there is an elevator to the guest room floors. It is rather small, old and rickety so if you usually avoid elevators in favor of the stairs, do realize it is a long steep climb up many flights of narrow stairs.  In summary, if you need lots of hot water, or lots of advice to getting around the city, or want room service, or just the right amount of heat or AC- find a real hotel. But do consider coming here for a retreat where you want to leave creature comforts behind.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "65", "attractions_nearby": "15", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["American", "French", "Italian", "Cafe"]},

This review is a correction.    My original problem was that the property charged the advance to my credit card (as agreed), but then didn't answer phone or email for a month.  So I figured it for a scam and bailed.  Then finally Philip did contact me and explained they were on vacation, the staff lost my many phone calls and emails, etc. etc and he'd only discovered my complaint because of my review here on TripAdvisor (!).  Philip enticed me to give it a try FOR FREE to make up for my distress.  So I did and here's my review.    The property DOES exist and is not a scam after all, whew.  It's at 59 E80th, which is the #1 advantage of this rental -- superb location, as another reviewer pointed out  ", " The price is $250-350ish which is not bad by NYC standards, not bad at all for a studio on the Upper East side.  The rooms have been recently refurbished and are fancy and nice: gleaming wood floors, and in the more expensive King room that we had, plenty of space (except see about the bathroom below).  There's still some refurbishing to be done, the closets are wonky, but overall the place is very nice, especially for Manhattan.  The bathroom is really, really small.  I think they cut a real bathroom in 1/4 and 3/4, then used the 1/4 for the bathroom and the other 3/4 for the kitchen.  If you are thin (maybe the lack of space is why so many New Yorkers are so thin? :-) the bathroom might be fine, but if you are a hefty American it might be impossible for you to function in there.  It worked ok for my wife and me.    Negative #1: the service is sadly poor.  Philip is a great guy, very nice, but he's so busy with his life that you never see him.  Of course this is a studio not a hotel, so you shouldn't need much service.  But we ran out of towels regularly (we do use a lot), and the cause of all my initial heartache was the poor phone and email communication.  Even after the incident, one of my fellow attendees had to cancel their reservation and had distress (multiple emails and eventually needed to get me involved to get through) getting an email confirmation from Philip.  So it wasn't just a one time thing -- Philip and crew really are just bad at email and phone.  You know how some people just don't respond to email and phone quickly, or sometimes at all?   It's not a crime, it's like a pre-electronic-culture thing.  I think it is bad in a business.   Negative #2: the building next door, and by \"next door\" in NYC I mean it literally shared a wall with my room, was under construction, and the workers tell me it will remain under construction until late 2009.  So, from 8am-3:30pm weekdays there are occasional jackhammers, talking, etc.  The workmen are nice and try to keep it down, and the noise is only intermittent and somewhat muffled.  Furthermore, Philip did warn us of this so it wasn't a shock.  Still, it was annoying, so be prepared if you want to sleep after 8am.      Small negative #3: the heat is not very controllable.  We found it cold but Philip said if he turned on the building heat that early in the year it'd probably be too warm.  So we settled for cold and bundled up a bit.    Bottom line: if you don't mind poor phone contact and service, don't need a standard American-sized bathroom, and you don't mind some noise during the weekdays, this is a good deal, nice digs, and a really excellent location.  It was delightful to step out of the building and be in an upscale neighborhood just a couple blocks from Park Ave, the Met, and 5 short blocks to the subway.  I gave them an extra star because my rooms were free to make up for the trouble, and I'd thought the price reasonable to begin with.  What's not to like about that?  All in all, my wife and I had a great time, and would stay here again -- after the construction next door is completed.", "\u2026", "We went to NYC on holidays, to meet up with some old friends. They live on Upper East Side and we wanted to find accommodation close by. I soon discovered that finding a decent priced hotel nearby would be quite a challenge, so I tried to find alternative accommodations online. I came across Anco Studios and sent them an email. Based on the information on their websites, it seemed OK, but I was nevertheless a bit worried about it all as I, at the time, couldn\u2019t find any reviews of the place online. However, our decision to take a chance and book a studio with Anco Studios proved to be very good!

We arrived close to midnight, however it was no problem to check in and we hardly had to wait.

Can\u2019t fault the building or the room (apart from one ring on the hob didn\u2019t work which made cooking tricky).

Bare in mind the people on reception and the manager of the apartments are different companies.  The manager of the apartments was not available when we wanted to speak to him and so we asked whoever we could find. At 2:03pm, the cleaner knocked on the door and asked when we were leaving. We explained that the man downstairs had given us 10 minutes grace to collect our clothing (some of which were tracksuit bottoms and two girls under 18 were in underwear in the room). She then nodded and proceeded to text the manager who came up two minutes later and knocked on the door again. He proceeded to shout and become very hostile and aggressive towards us. I tried to explain that we\u2019d been given ten minutes to allow us to put our clothes in from the dryer, but he started to push his way into the room whilst shouting, which is when I tried to close the door on him as the girls had to hide in the bathroom where they didn\u2019t have any clothes on their bottom halves. After five minutes of shouting at us we had no choice but to leave the room with the girls having towels wrapped around their waists for modesty. It was an absolute disgrace! We were able to get them dressed in the laundry room with a bit of privacy once their clothes had dried, and then went into the managers office to return the keys. Again he began shouting abuse at myself and other members of the party, saying that the guests who were checking into the room after us had requested an early check-in at 2:30pm, and he needed us out on time. He should not have taken $50 from us for a late check out and the same from them for the same room! Especially when we made sure it would be okay to leave ten minutes late because of the clothes being in the dryer! Absolutely disgusted with the behaviour of this man, I wish he\u2019d given us his name but he wouldn\u2019t. He sat there the whole time with his earphones in and when I asked him to take them out he said he \u2018wasn\u2019t listening to music so what did it matter\u2019!

But they were very helpful, especially when we checked out they allowed us to store our luggage in the office so we could still explore the city for the day. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

And already the booking there are reviews that these are scammers, I attach a screenshot of the same deceived people!!!  That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing a review https: // www. tripadvisor.ru and wherever I can add a review! The receptionists of this hotel just bullied us from the moment we arrived! At 11 am we found ourselves in the most criminal district of New York!!!! Yes, yes, this is where this awful hostel is located!!!!! Not was it not in the box where our key was supposed to be, and we just stood under the house for more than", " an hour and could not get into the paid room. As a result of a long correspondence with the administrators of the hostel, just a resident of the rooms opened the door of the hostel!!! Entering the room, we found that we were not given a magnetic key to the street door and the key to the front door, that is, if we leave the room to get back, we need to stand and wait for at least someone from this hostel!!! Because this is an ordinary residential building!!! When I wrote to the hostel administrators in the booking chat, they said \u2014 yes, there are no keys, but we will make it!!!! And when will you give it to us? I asked. To which they answered me \u2014 to try faster!!!! Can you imagine??? That is, I flew to New York for 2 weeks and it is not clear how many days I have to sit in the room and wait for the key???? We were waiting for at least some answer from the hotel administrators, but they just stopped responding to us!!!!!!! That is, at 12.30 at night we just sat and waited for at least some answer!!! In the end, my husband and I took the suitcase and left this awful place!!!!!!! But!!! These dishonest people did not return our security deposit!!!!!!!!!! We paid money booking \u2014 and this amount was returned to us by booking after we read all our correspondence and were just shocked by these deceivers. But according to the rules of this hostel, we had to send them a $ 200 security deposit!!! NEVER SEND like we did!!! And in the end, these cheaters accused us of stealing the towel from them!!!!!!!!!!! Can you imagine??? We flew across the world to steal a towel from this terrible hostel!!!!!!! And in the end they returned us $ 125!!!!!!! And $ 75 was just stolen from us!!! These are shameless, dishonest cheats, never contact this hostel!!! There are many wonderful places in New York, but not this!!! All correspondence, evidence I have in the booking!!!! Until this awful hotel returns for $ 75, which was simply dishonestly stolen from us, I will write wherever possible so that people do not contact this place!!!

We travel on a budget often and love to stay in hostels when we can.

There are just a couple things that I think people should be aware of before booking. When we first arrived for check in, we walked up the street and back before finding the building we believed was the one (there is now no tree out front so it confused us), then went up to the door and pressed the bell button (that they wound up changing to say Incentra Home while we were still staying here which is exactly what I would\u2019ve recommended as it was a bit confusing to locate). Once someone came to open the", " door, we were escorted to the first floor kitchen where the guy told us a few things like where the laundry room is located, check out protocol, and gave us the code for our room as well as the front door. We then payed the rest of the room fees and taxes and went up to our room on the third floor(Room 3E). The different floors follow different color themes and it is  a very cute and modern look. They definitely have updated the style and bathrooms to make it more modern and hip, which is very nice. I will say that our room did not meet the expectations set by the photos though. The halls and rooms seem to be pretty dark, and although we knew it would be a small room, we were surprised with how old and worn the room actually seemed. The main problem was the bed, it was pretty small(I believe a full size not queen which I don\u2019t believe I saw on the site) and the last door or two of the bed was at a complete slope downward. It was like we were sleeping on an old futon. Anyways, we did sleep pretty comfortably and the bathrooms were nice and spacious. The backyard has some furniture that is breaking down a bit but a nice place to go outside to eat or smoke. Also the kitchens are updated and useful if you have something you want to store in the refrigerators but they are smelly and there is A Lot of food stored in them that seems old.
