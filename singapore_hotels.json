It turned out that no USB ports were provided and the fairy lights were so weak they almost looked dead. The actual setup looked quite plain and underwhelming compared to images online. An ice box was provided, and you would expect that at least a bottle of water would be included there, given the price.", " But nope.  We tried to contact Glamping City to ask about the promised USB ports and procedure in the event of a thunderstorm. I called both hotlines provided over email and tried to get in touch with the staff who \"checked us in\", but no one was picking up. This actually raises some safety concerns, and it gives the impression that Glamping City doesn't actually have any service staff on standby.  Some positive notes: the tent was sturdy enough to prevent water entry, and the inflatable beds were sufficiently sized.  In short, this was more of a camping experience than a \"glamping\" experience. Many of the amenities provided could be sourced out on your own at a much lower cost, with just a little bit of prep time. The public washrooms were also quite far from the campsite and quite dirty, so be prepared.", "\u2026", "We booked 2 family tents. Tents were set-up next to our booked bbq pit which was nice.

Book at your own risk.", "I stayed here for a few days. It is a great location, where it locates at the back of the Raffles Hotel. It takes about five minutes to walk to a shopping mall, which is not as big as Vivo but big enough to see the glory of Singapore.   The room is a loft. It has a bathroom, closet, a small kitchenette, which also has a bench as a desk. There is a queen-size bed on the loft.  It equipped a toaster, water heater, a small pan, and slivers. It also has a microwave oven and a refrigerator.  Hand soap, dish soap, and laundry detergent are provided. For visitors from the US, there is not dishwasher as it is not common in Singapore. The laundry machine is on the third floor.   The check-in and check-out processes were very smooth. A deposit of S$300 is required at the check-in. The", " staff worked with me through phone, and Whatsapp is another option. I contacted her twice during my stay, and she responded immediately.   The property does not provide housekeeping, as I stay less than a week. For the toilet kit, they only provide shampoo and shower soap. I got other things from the grocery store located in the nearby shopping mall. It does not provide tea or coffee either. In Singapore, there are many coffee shops. It is just me that I need tea or coffee as the first thing in the morning. I purchased some from the shopping mall.   The bed is not fancy. It is okay. If you are taller than me, 5.5 feet, it is likely you will hit the ceiling. I hit the corner of the roof with my head a few times. Also, be very careful when walking on the stairs. It is quite narrow, and you do need to watch your head to avoid heating the corner. I did enjoy sitting at the stair to view the Raffle hotel.   The property has an Apple TV on the loft. It does not provide local TV programs but internet entertainment, such as Netflix. I do not know how to use the Apple TV remote. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, but I'd never figured out how to input the password of Netflix (provided by the landlord) to watch anything. It does not bother me much, though.  The internet is not stable, and the air conditioner needs some cleaning. The bathroom also needs some upgraded. Between the shower and toilet, there is a light curtain. It is not dirty, but I kept myself away from the curtain. See pictures. The remote control of the air conditioner is not very sensitive.   Overall, it is a good price at such a great location. A few improvements in the cleaning of the air conditioner and bathroom will make it more desirable. I would appreciate a couple of tea or coffee bags and removing trashes every a couple of days. If you will use Grab or taxi, this apartment is located in the ERP area, where the driver has to pay to the government additional fees to drive into this busy area. It means the fees will be higher than the Grab app shows. Note, Grab is like Uber in other countries. I travel about 15 trips a year, and I sometimes like to stay in a B&B or apartment instead of the chained hotels to experience a different setting. I like I was not bothered by anyone during my stay, and I like the decoration and cozy feeling of this apartment.", "\u2026", "Booked the Premium Loft and the photos certainly did not do it justice, it's way better when you step inside the 'apartment'. Staff were friendly and easily reachable. Location is great with many dining options in the area, as well as, shopping malls and grocery shopping. Love the kitchen that's equipped with a small electric cooker along with knives, cutting board, crockery and cutlery. Perhaps not for MasterChef cooking but we fed ourselves well enough for a hearty breakfast and mini hotpot dinner.   Really enjoyed the cosy environment and would certainly return. However, note to self to bring toothbrush as it's not provided. Satisfied with the bathroom and amenities nonetheless.", "Booking.com indicated the room we wanted was available. We called the hotel to ask for directions 2X & were advised in a detailed manner. Upon reaching the entry point, we were refused entry even to the lobby by 2 different staff stating we had to have a reservation to be allowed in. We mentioned we would like to view the room first & would make the decision thereafter. They sent their Property Manager who said that they are fully booked until 9 September.  It was a team of very very poorly trained staff with terrible teamwork & no shared data among themselves. Neither did they practice common sense. A few blatant lies stuck out like sore thumbs.  2 hours after this incident, the room specified was still indicated as available on booking.com.", "The first thing I noticed when I entered the apartment was how extremely small it is and that it looked nothing like the photos. There wasn't even space to put our bags so it's actually more recommended for solo travellers as it doesn't even fit couples. The room also had a very damp weird smell, combined by how dark the room is even with all the lights on, makes it feel like you're in a gas station motel. Our TV didn't work, it kept switching on and off but in the few \"good\" times it did, the remotes wouldn't work too.   Our rooms were right next to the laundry area, so we were promised that by 10pm the washer and dryers would be turned off to all guest but for many nights we would wake up to the loud noises of the dryers at the wee hours of 3 and 4 am so we had to turn them", " off ourselves causing us a lack of sleep. I believe if you made a promise, you should keep it! I left the apartment at 6am one morning and there was soap all over the floor from the laundry and I almost slipped! I got back at 5pm and almost slipped a second time cause no one has come to attend to the mess. There's no upkeep whatsoever.   The last straw was when my husband nearly fell down the staircase cause the staircase railing came off the cheap glue they used for the railing! The staircase is really very steep. The railing that came off was right at the top of the stairs, if he would've fell, he would've went straight down into the glass doors and it could very have easily been a fatal fall. We then contacted Ray, and as lovely as she is, we knew she was just as dumbfounded and not of much help to situation unfortunately. I have pictures proving all of this and we have yet to receive any apology whatsoever. This apartment ruined our Christmas and they're a massive disappointment.

Summary: it was enough for the price and the hurry of not find nothing else available. Remember that in Singapore almost everything related with accommodation is expensive, and finding a good place is difficult. You can rent with them a month and during that", " period look for a better place, or arrange with a friend.

The double bed is too close to the main door, making it difficult to get in and out either with or without luggage.

I was not aware at the time of the booking that the K hotel 12 is situated on the edge of what is locally known as 'Sin City' or redlight district, Geylang, of Singapore.  In the evenings, after 9pm, the streets in Geylang become noisey from cars honking, people loitering and talking loudly most of the night, you can overhear bargaining and dealing with minders outside the illegal and legal brothels, so if you're a very light sleeper, my advice is to have earplugs with you during your stay.  There is a small mini-mart nearby and cafe's for provisions and quick dining, but I would try and get what you need before evening, to avoid brothel minders in the streets trying to get business from you and to meet the ladies inside the homes and hotels. There are many rent by the hour hotels and every even numbered street has a string of brothels in them.  In my opinion, I would only recommend this hotel for the budget conscious traveller, if you are single or travelling with other singles, but not suitable for families with children.  Despite it's sleazy reputation, Geylang has some great eateries and street food and relatively close to the Suntec City Convention Centre.

It\u2019s better to arrive in SG late at night or early morning to avoid the notorious heat & humidity.    It\u2019s like walking inside a toaster-oven during the day, so keep hydrated and bring a small towel to wipe the you dry from all the perspiring.  The hotel is about a kilometer walk from the Kallang MRT Station but if you\u2019re dragging a big luggage while sweating & huffing, it\u2019s quite a feat.  Singapore is near the equator so walking around is no fun.    Along the way, you'll see some food stalls but a few of them open late.  I noticed one that was extremely popular among", " drivers that serves Malay-Indian dishes.  The area is in a quiet road but right across a main thoroughfare on whose side trees and other greeneries were planted to buffer from the dust and fumes.   The hotel is housed in a recessed, nondescript building with glass door entrance.   Check-in was prompt & manned all the time as it seems the place also serves as a love hotel.    The elevator, although small, is quite fast.  It can accommodate maybe 3 people with big suitcases.   The room is small - about 8 x 10, with a high 12-foot ceiling. but as we were assigned an 8th-floor room that fronts the street, there\u2019s great view of the Singapore skyline from the window.    So expect to sort your stuff on top of the bed if you have a big luggage as there\u2019s limited room to wiggle around.  The bathroom is about 4.5 square feet. You shower on the same area where the toilet bowl & sink are \u2013 so a flipflops helps. The shower pressure is great & hot water flow is great -- if you\u2019re afraid of taking cold showers \u2013 which is ideal- in very hot & humid Singapore.    Towels -very thin- & toothbrushes were provided but there were no other toiletries. The sheets are clean but another set of pillows would help travelers get better rest.  The overhead A/C is operated by a remote control & takes a bit of fiddling to get to one's choice of temperature --specially if you're in the room at mid-day.  The ad says \u201csmoke-free guestrooms\u201d but we smelled hints of tar or nicotine in our room.  The hotel is so close to Geylang Road which is dotted with cheap shops & eating places and known as the \u2018red light district\u2019 of Singapore. So before you head back to your room, get your food, snacks & drinks from these shops & save a lot.  They open early, too!  Even at most cheap eating places, you may find the price of beer expensive (about S$8 for a liter) but at 'hawker food centers', it's OK to bring your beer bought from some place else.  The bus stop in front of the hotel doesn\u2019t service the places of interests so just use the Kallang MRT as your base or take the buses along Geylang Road (the closest one fronts the Mohd Salleh Mosque) to avoid walking long distances in this very humid place.    As a final tip, take bus #100 and got off near Golden Mile Food Center -about 10 minutes from Geylang Road- and enjoy some of the best  'hawker food' Singapore has to offer!", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "155", "attractions_nearby": "26", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "78", "top_cuisines": ["Chinese", "Chinese", "Chinese"]},

I have found they leave a key card in the holder to ensure the room is nice to come back to after a day out... nice! The hotel has a cafe and it has a good range of food at reasonable prices.

This is my review from that perspective.  Noise - I stayed here with my sister so we got a capsule meant for 2 and I guess that was partially the problem; there were only 2 double capsules and they were both near the entrance & pantry so there's a fair bit of traffic there, which inevitably meant more noise.  It didn't help that: we were light sleepers, the only things separating the inside of our capsule and the entire dorm were a single layer of curtains, and we got the bottom capsule.  The first night was difficult.    Smell - The place as a whole was clean; pantry and toilets were well lit and furnished so no complaints there. The blanket and sheets of the bed were", " fine too... but there's an inexplicable god awful smell (like feet smell) that would come in wafts when we were right outside our capsule (that's where our luggage and stuff was).  We couldn't locate where the smell originated from and it might have even been the stench of weary travellers but the recollection of it even now makes my nose hairs curl.  Privacy \u2013 Not much different from that of a dormitory style hostel aside from the curtains separating your capsule. You do get lockers for your stuff.  Location - Really a close walk to the nearest MRT station once we got our bearings right.  But our first Grab driver couldn't quite locate it - it's tucked into a corner near a couple of food places/pubs and a construction site (at the time of travel). One night not far from the hostel, a couple of men were yelling at each other nearing a fight (I assume they were inebriated).  It's not exactly a seedy area but this is just something to note.  Summary: Relatively affordable, clean, well equipped and public transport is easily accessible; trade off would be the noise and privacy.", "\u2026", "This is an excellent, easy going hostel type place, very clean well maintain, higly reccomend it if you want something great, and excellent location, only 2 mnts from MRT station,  Very quite, good chance to speak to other travellers, easy access,", "We really appreciate the location and the accomodation.

Here are little more details on my experience -  Apartment Visit and Selection Phase: During my first visit, Ms Veronica was very helpful to explain everything in detail. My first impression of the apartment after seeing it were: 1) it offers the best possible views that you can get in Singapore 2) the apartment has everything that you need for your living and the utilization of space is outstanding. I visited a few other options around Singapore and had to come back here for a second visit, which Ms Veronica dealt with similar energy as she did for the first time. My choice of this was rather easy given the two key facts mentioned", " above; and also due to the prime location of this property that makes you live close to everything you need. The high street center is mainly an office building with only a few floors at the top being used for residential purpose - I viewed this as a positive too since this helps to reduce the crowd. The property is near to a few bus stops and just 3-4 minute walk away from a MRT station.  Moving in and the Apartment: On my moving in date I was told to contact the housekeeper Mr Tun; when I called his mobile he addressed me with my first name. I was impressed with that since it shows the professionalism of the management. Mr Tun helped me to bring all my luggage up to the apartment and he explained me about it and the facilities. During my initial discussions with Ms Veronica from the sales, I mentioned to her about my need of additional hangers and two sets of wine glasses. Those were ready and Mr Tun also did mentioned to me that you asked for them so they are here (which was a great experience as well since they take care of your wishes in detail).  My apartment is a 1BHK, close to 600 Sq Ft, is fully furnished & well decorated, has a fully functional kitchen, all appliances that you need for living (TV, refrigerator, induction hob with chimney, washer cum dryer, oven, microwave, toaster, kettle, rice cooker, Bluetooth music player, hair dryer, iron with board etc), has cable TV with HBO & Fox, high speed fiber internet with your own dedicated wired/WiFi modem (was super easy for me to set up my home office and TelePresence unit), has plenty of storage spaces (I couldn't utilize them all as I was living alone, even for a family of 3-4 the storage seemed to be good enough) and is extremely well lit. In both living room and the bed room, there are lot of full length mirrors that create an optical illusion of having more space through the reflection, which makes you feel better. The upper part of the glass windows can be opened in both rooms, making outside air circulation possible through the apartment. The queen bed was comfy with different pillow options as per the need. The working desk was good w.r.to both working space and storage but that was inside the bedroom, which may not be the perfect arrangement, but was manageable for me. The bathroom was also good with all required amenities to make me comfortable. The facility at the lobby level has two entrances, where one of them is manned 24x7 with a security personnel while the other one on the riverside being a more private one. The overall security arrangements of the facility is great with full CCTV coverage, 24x7 security personnel, 3 layers of locks/access requirement to get into your apartment and all secured doors in the common area of the apartment.  Ongoing Service: One North Bridge provides once in a week service, which is light touch and in my view is rightly balanced between the servicing needs and privacy. The service person Ms Helen is superb, always smiling with great attitude and she did an awesome job to help me keep my apartment nice and clean. The folks in the management office like Ms Unice are great. I always received prompt response to all my need and they were always informing me a week in advance before any scheduled maintenance activities. The finance department was very helpful to process all related matters promptly and provide the invoices in time. Overall, I felt it is all these great people with their great attitude and service, that makes this place even better to live.", "\u2026", "1.
