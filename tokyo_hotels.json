Not helpful ppl at the reception!!! Not able to accommodate a differently abled person!! The room is barely fit for one person!!", "Recently stayed here at mystays kamedio. 2 adult males. We had 9 nights booked here at what we thought was a great price. 2 beds a bathroom microwave fridge and only 30 minutes to Shibuya Crossing. We stayed 2 nights before we cancelled the rest of our stay to book at a different hotel.  This room is very small. With the beds together touching there is no room for the person against  the wall to go around to use the \u2018airplane size\u2019 bathroom. He or she must climb over the other persons bed.  The room has nowhere to put your suitcase to be out of the way. If you leave it on the floor you trip over it trying to move around. If you put it on the counter it blocks the tv or what little counter space is available.   The breakfast.  Not worth the money. There will be nothing there you", " will like. And it\u2019s $10-$15 per person per day. Don\u2019t waste your money. There is a mister donut on your way to the subway stop there and grab a couple donuts for breakfast. It will be more satisfying. My friend just said the food is straight up disgusting. Fried eggs on ice is how he explains the eggs.   Positive note. The staff was awesome and the hotel refunded us for 7 of the 9 nights. there is a convenience store right outside the hotel.   If you read this and you still book this hotel. You have been warned.", "\u2026", "Starting with the positive: The hotel is quiet, the location is a short walk to the subway and when you get the room it is clean. There is a convenience store across the road but it is usually picked clean if you go after 9 pm  The staff are friendly.   As for the rest of it: The room is ridiculously small given the price you pay , it is the size of a large bathroom. The bathroom is so small you hit the bathtub when you sit on the toilet. The room is not serviced during your stay and then there is a cleaning fee when you check out. A breakfast buffet is available but if you want a western style breakfast you are pretty much out of luck do he trays are usually empty of food.  The pictures on line do not accurately reflect the room.", "i stay for a week,staff is friendly and the room is enough for my self,no have make up room (even a time for one week) but you can add aminities and change towel everytime if you want. bath room and toilet so small and highes then room,i dont like it. but not so far from kameido stasiun.", "I\u2019m a US traveler and booked this hotel for the New Years.

I wish I had paid attention to the reviews and looked elsewhere. There are other hotels close by and at comparable rates--I highly recommend choosing another property.  All the reviews that say the TBAW is dated and dingy are spot on. When I walked into the lobby to check in, it looked like a construction zone...but it wasn't. There are just racks of temporary shelves and a significant fraction of the lobby was roped off as bag storage. Like other reviewers, I was given a smoking room in spite of my non-smoking preference.

I tried to check out and", " find a different hotel but was told I would be charged for the entire week either way. So if the room makes you sick, too bad.

The trash cans in common areas were often over flowing, vending machines were broken, and there were even empty beer cans on the table by the elevator for several days.   Was it the worst place I've ever stayed? No, but it was bad enough that I was willing to check out and try my luck finding another place to stay without a reservation.

MANY Pros First: Location, Location, Location!!!! 3 minute walk from Shimbashi Station with at least 4 lines including the mostly used Yamanote line (even has an indoor underground access across the street to avoid rain), 3 minute walk to Ginza (2 blocks or just cross the train tracks) about 4 blocks to the street where they close the famous High End shop street on Sundays, Donki  Ginza is 5 minutes walk, countless", " combinis (even have Lawson on second floor) Ichi**n, the famous ramen shop is just accross the Shimbashi station and the upscale version of the ramen place in Ginza is also few blocks aways. So much food option around the area! Second: Hotel Staff. They are the most accommodating staff especially the tall European young guy who's always ready to greet and so friendly.  The cleaning ladies are very friendly as well. I've visited Japan every year and most cleaning staff are very timid when a foreigner approach them but the The Blossom Hibiya staff are very courteous and polite and ready to help. Third: The room, we booked a corner room Deluxe Double. The highlight of the room is definitely the gorgeous view and the automatic window blinds that could even sync to the alarm clock! Everything is being controlled in a side table tablet! Room is always clean (kudos to the staff), the firmness of the bed is just right!  My husband and I also appreciated the 2 daily complimentary bottled water, wine opener, high quality wine and water glasses, not a huge fan of the UCC coffee maker (coffee was awful), I think you guys should change that to Nespresso. I also appreciate the daily tea! All and all, We found a new hotel that my husband and I will go regularly, we used to go to this high rise hotel in Shinagawa for the past 6 years but this hotel definitely impressed us. So much food option around! Two of my favorite desert Osaka's Pablo and Hokkaido's LeTao cheesecake is inside the station!!! We are definitely going back!

", "Having spent a pleasant week in Tokyo, staying in a very small but comfortable room at the Tokyu Inn, we needed to use the laundry service on our last day. In the morning we dropped off our laundry and asked if we could pay upfront, to which we were told was not possible. Upon collecting our laundry we were footed a bill for around 21,000 yen (\u00a3123) for a few t-shirts and dresses. Whilst I completely understand it is our fault for not checking a price list, when I simply asked if that bill was correct, suddenly the man became incredibly rude and agitated, and started angrily and deliberately hitting the keys of his calculator with force, frowning at us and throwing it down on the desk like a child. Considering how polite and helpful everyone has been in Tokyo we found his", " behavior to be incredibly rude and not reminiscent of the general attitude of the city. We thanked him for checking again merely to be greeted with what can only be described as a 'dirty look' and no response. It may seem minor but being addressed like an idiot after essentially being completely ripped off sullied our view of this hotel.", "\u2026", "The hotel is located in Shimbashi area, best way to reach is either by Narita express to Tokyo Station and then onto Subway to either Shimbashi (15min walk) or Toramonon station (10min walk). I would suggest against using taxis unless you have no other choice or simply can afford it!   The room was clean and compact as i expected from my research on hotels in Tokyo, since i was solo this wasnt a problem and i never faced any issues in terms of space. I never took the breakfast package but instead had it in Shangri-la next door, if you book in advance its 1200Yen, if you pay at the door its 1400Yen. The staff where very helpful and polite. The room has no safe but i deposited my valuables with the desk which they put into a safe so its good enough. They still have an old key", " system but thankfully you do not need to carry this around as you can deposit it when leaving and collected when you arrive back (the front desk is open 24 hours with at least 3 members on at all times).   The area is fairly quiet compared to some areas in Tokyo so if youre expecting a hussling and bustling night life you will surely be mistaken, that said there are plenty of shops restaurants and coffee places nearby to keep you entertained, Shimbashi is 15mins walk and plenty of small bars and restaurants there.   Night life is mainly in Roppongi and Shinjuku, Roppongi is only 1 stop from Kamyacho station on the Hibiya line, the station takes less than 7 mins to walk from exiting the hotel. You can also connect to Shinjuku from Roppongi on the Oedo line. To be fair the subway system is so well connected you can reach anywhere in Tokyo within 25mins. Only downside is if you are out after midnight you will need to catch a cab (that will burn a hole in your pocket if in Shinjuku and staying here)   All in all it was a nice place to stay considering the price i paid and the size of my room its most definantly worth it. Would most certainly stay again if im back in Tokyo.", "\u2026", "I have just returned from a 6 day night stay in Tokyo and for the price we paid, I wasn't disappointed with the Tokyu Inn hotel.  The hotel is in a good location with three subway stops all within a 10 minute walking distance. We often used the Ginza line so having Toranomon on the doorstep was extremely useful. If you choose to take the Skyliner from Narita airport to the terminus at Ueno, you can easily transfer to the Ginza line ( which is also at Ueno), making the trip to and from the airport manageable and affordable. The hotel is also only 10-15 minutes walk to Shinbashi station which has plenty of restaurants to eat in. I enjoyed exploring the local area, Tokyo tower is just down the road as are many beautiful shrines and temples.  I arrived in Tokyo very late at night,", " but contacted the hotel the day before my arrival to warn them about my late check in. The staff were expecting me when I arrived at around 1am and check in was quick and easy. The rooms were small but adequate. The double size bed was slightly on the small side but we managed ok. The bathroom was again small but had everything you could possibly need. Shampoo, conditioner and shower gel came in big bottles which was much better than the usual small bottles provided in hotels.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the reception provided me with wifi passwords for the hotel room, which I wasn't expecting after reading previous reviews. The only slight issue  I had with the room was that it was quite hot and the air conditioning didn't seem to be very effective. This wasn't too much a problem in April but it would have been in the summer months.  Finally breakfast was better than imagined. The selection comprised of Western ( pastries, egg, sausages, cereals, fruit etc) and Japanese food. We left breakfast full every morning so no complaints there. Breakfast was very busy around the 7am mark, so if you can afford to go a little later it is much less crowded.  All in all a good stay for a city break as long as you're not expecting massive rooms with 5* service.", "\u2026", "We got this hotel using air miles but we would not recommend staying here unless you had to or it was free/cheap. The room was extremely small with no storage space and only two hangers to hang your clothes on the wall. The room was extremely dusty and nobody had cleaned under the bed in a very long time. We can only work of the room we stayed in, which was in the older building. We asked to change but was politely told we could not. Location wasn't bad as Shinbashi station was only a 10 minute walk away or 25 minutes taxi to Shinjuku (3000yen) We stayed in far nicer hotels in Tokyo and would recommend paying a little more for one of these.

I stayed here as part of a tour group going around Japan.  The hotel is in a great location.  It is only about 500 meters or so from the Ginza shopping street.  There are plenty of restaurants and stores around as well.  There is a 7-Eleven very close that is above a convenience store but just below a mini market.  You can find lots of prepared foods there such as sandwiches, pizzas, etc.. there.  There is also an ATM in the 7-Eleven that will accept foreign ATM cards since not all bank ATMs in Japan accept foreign cards.    If you go out the back of the hotel and turn left and keep going in that direction you will hit a wide river which has a nice walk along it.  I saw men fishing from the side.  You will", " pass I think it was called St. Lukes hospital(thats right is has an English name).  The hotel is located off the streets but taxis can get to it but not buses.  There are two alleys that angle out the front of the hotel to a street.  This is the direction you want to go for nearby restaurants and the 7-Eleven.  The hotel has a good size lobby that is spacious in Japanese terms.  You can tell this is above a 3 star hotel by just seeing it.  That is my opinion.  The hotel has a restaurant on the 2nd floor.  I had all my breakfasts there.  They will give you a choice of Western or Japanese breakfast.  The breakfast was good though their eggs are cooked a way I am not used to.  The rest was goodl, especially the croissant.  I am not certain if they serve other meals but I would not be surprised if they did.  Upon entering my room my bathroom is on the right.  It has a sliding door that closes off the bathroom.  Inside the bathroom the shower is on the right.  Entering the shower you come immediatley to the shower portion with has a choice of a hand shower head or the shower head in the ceiling.  Next to the shower and only accessible via the shower is the Japanese style bath tub(sort of like a half American bath tub with higher walls).  In the shower you have access to large bottles of bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner.  The bath towels are right above the bathtub after I looked around.  The shower and bathtub are enclosed in see-thru plexiglass.  Same as the shower door.  Going past the bathroom you come to the bedroom with the queen size  bed on your right.  On the left side of the side(furtherest from the bathroom) there is room to easily move around.  The right side if I recall is virtually against the well.  I did not see any electrical outlets next to the bed but there are light switches for the room.  Opposite from the foot of the bed is a counter with the LCD TV on top of it.  In the corner near the window is a typical hotel desk.  There is a row of Type A(two prong) American type plug in(standard in Japan).  I would say you could plug in at least 3 in the row if you wanted.  The TV had only Japanese stations on it except CNN but it was being dubbed in Japanese.  There were options on the TV to watch movies, etc. on it as well  I forgot to mention there is a small refrig under the counter where the TV is located.  It is empty and you can put some things in it.  Overall, this was a very nice hotel to stay at in a great location where you can walk around.

Room are very clean and they provide skin care essentials for women.", "We enjoyed our stay here. Bed was comfortable. Like the style. And the best part was that they provide a foot massage which was god sent after all the walking it was a relief. Location was not bad at all. ", "Overall, I think this was a decent stay.  I stayed here for 8 nights and I will list all the pros and cons below:  Pros: + Staff was excellent, with most speaking decent English and very friendly and responsive to requests + Location is pretty convenient with proximity to Akasaka Excel Tokyu Hotel (good if you are using the Airport Limousine Bus which will drop you off there) so it was a short 3 min walk to the hotel across the street. There are also 3 subway lines nearby: Akasaka-Mitsuke, Akasaka, and Nagatacho + Hotel gives free water, soup, and continental breakfast + They provide a free cel phone to use while you're there (I didn't know about this until after I checked into my room, which would have been great as I already bought a SIM card)  Cons (negatives): - Room was", " very small. I know, this is Japan, so you were probably already expecting it, but I still didn't expect it to be this small based on the pictures I saw online.  You cannot lay a large suitcase down and open it up without leaning part of it against the wall. - The hot water in the shower was not working properly everyday. There were spurts in the shower when it would go cold really quick and then scalding hot the next second. I had to learn this pattern so I could jump out of the way when it was super hot to avoid burns.  It did this every time I took a shower, but I learned to live with it. - The carpets seemed to be dirty (the pattern on the carpet is such that you can't tell if it's really dirty, but I could tell it was dirty). - The lighting is not too bright in the room or bathroom - Since the bathroom is so small, there really isn't anywhere to place your personal toiletries other than on top of the toilet seat. - There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom, so I had to use the hairdryer in the bedroom area while sitting on my bed. - For some reason, my keycard kept getting de-magnetized. I had to get a new keycard 4 different times during my stay. This was highly inconvenient.  The guy at the front desk suggested maybe it's because I had it near other cards in my wallet or man-bag, but I made sure to keep it separate on a few other occasions and it still happened. There's something wrong with their machines, I guess.  Overall, it was a decent stay and I would definitely consider it again though due to the location.  There are a lot of great drinking/eating places nearby.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": ["Modern", "Business"], "price": "5838", "best_price_source": "ZenHotels.com", "restraunts_nearby": "1414", "attractions_nearby": "70", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "90", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Japanese", "Japanese", "Japanese"], "restaurants": [{"name": "Sheyda Bar", "cusines": ["", "Bar"], "reviews": "11 reviews"}, {"name": "The Mermaid", "cusines": [" Bar, Pub "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Cheepao Maratan, Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Mamano Chocolate", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Le Connaisseur Akasaka", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Omusubi Gonbei, Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Bistro Vino Roppongi", "cusines": ["", "Grill", "Diner"], "reviews": "17 reviews"}, {"name": "Yamadenmaru, Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "AKASAKARAOMAHINABE", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Kissho Saryo", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kushiten Yamamotoya", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Wagyu Shokunin Akasaka Honten", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shabugen", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "25 reviews"}, {"name": "Home Cooking Higurashi", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Kyosuke", "cusines": [", Kappo ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Maruumo Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Ando", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Zesun Dining", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Emmado Akasaka", "cusines": ["", "Chinese"], "reviews": "7 reviews"}, {"name": "A Un ", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Akasakasekkado", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kuimonya Hitotsu Akasaka Mitsuke", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Manjuan", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Akasaka Edozakura", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Bifteck Kawamura Roppongi branch", "cusines": ["", "Grill"], "reviews": "24 reviews"}, {"name": "Izakaya Sambyakuenya Akasa Kamitsuke", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Umibun Nabebun Akasaka", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Kayagumu", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Live House Stage-1", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Akasaka Spain Club Ala", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Gonpachi Nori-Temaki Harajuku", "cusines": ["", "Sushi", "Japanese", "Seafood", "Asian", "Healthy"], "reviews": "29 reviews"}, {"name": "Grilled Pork Tavern Ginbuta Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Jizake Shochu Zen Akasaka", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Matoi", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sukiyaki Hokusai", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Chugokuchabo 8 Akasaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nakamigawa", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "1 reviews"}]},

Furnishings are a bit dated but everything is clean and functional. No place to store your luggage, 2 hangers on a wall hook, no dresser drawers, no closet. Essentially you live out of your luggage. One small in room TV with zero western stations. The hotel buffet in Plumeria Restaurant was reasonably price when added to the initial booking. The price was less than $10 USD per person. If you buy the breakfast buffet in person, you will pay 1400 yens. Plumeria Restaurant offers a mix of western and Japanese breakfast items. Dinner price at", " Plumeria Restaurant is around 2200 yens for a thin steak, 1 floret of broccoli, 1 slice of carrot, 1 dollop of potatoe, 1 tea cup of soup, and 1 mini cup of coffee. The pork cutlet dinner there is around 1700 yens. For dinner, you can do much better at nearby walkable restaurants. Several mini markets and grocery stores are close by too. Hanzomon Metro Subway Station is less than 5 minutes walk from hotel. You can reach most areas of Tokyo via train transfers. A refreshing walk to the Imperial Palace grounds is quite doable from Diamond Hotel also. Diamond hotel and Plumeria restaurant staff were very polite and attentive to your needs when asked. The free WiFi internet connection in the room often drops off. WiFi connection in the lobby is better.

The rooftop garden was a primary attraction, but was cordoned off because of some wet weather.

Now we all know that room size is not overly generous in Japan. However ACT rooms are listed as 'economic double' - they are not - they are singles, as confirmed to me by the manager when I needed to book an extra night over the phone.

The hotel is rather new, opened in late 2018. The hotel offers no breakfast, the rooms only.  We had a double bed room, which was on the tiny side but in very good and clean condition. Desk and minfridge - no content - and a very well working AC unit.

There is no English Channel on the TV. The free wifi did not work inspite of our complaints. The toilet is very clean and has all amenities ( however the shaving razors were of poor quality).

You have four breakfast sets which never change including one with toast, omelette, salad , yogurt and s single cup/ glass of hot or cold beverage. The juices are unlimited but we did not try them. The cafe is open to outsiders too and seem fairly busy and you can eat till late night.Overall we were quite happy with our stay.

Considering that we were first time tourists to Japan, we anyway did not spend any time in the room.   The hotel is neat, clean and efficient in whatever services we used it for. Being adjacent to the Kiyosumi Shirakawa metro station meant that getting to any corner of Tokyo was a breeze. We used the metro extensively during our 5 days there and at night, the metro exit being next door was a boon because we used to spend 10 - 12 hours on foot traipsing around Tokyo.  A 24-hour Family Mart next door and 2 large department stores round the corner (1 minute) mean that one could get something to eat or drink at any time.

The three nights that we spent in Tokyo, we stayed at the Ryumeikan Tokyo Hotel and the experience from beginning to end has been very pleasant.   After making the booking online, we got in contact with the hotel via email and asked them to please ensure that our room was non-smoking and away from smoking floors. The hotel responded within 2 hours indicating that our request was going to be granted.   The first thing you notice when you reach the hotel is that the location is top. You are just a couple of minutes walking from Tokyo main train station (direct trains from Narita and Haneda Airports), Nihombashi subway, loads of restaurants to choose from and main attractions such as the Imperial Palace, Tsukiji fish", " market or the neighbourhoods of Shibuya and Akihabara are \u201caround the corner\u201d. On the hotel\u2019s door step there is a nice restaurant, a couple of coffee shops and a 24/7 convenient store where you can grab a sandwich in the night if you are too tired and don\u2019t fancy to dine in a restaurant.   Reception is in the top (15th) floor. Upon arrival the staff is very pleasant, polite, and they speak English. The weather was cold, so receiving warm wet little towels to clean your hands and face was very welcoming and nice gesture from them.   We booked one of the smallest versions of the possible configurations offered by the hotel; our room was located on the 14th floor. The room do not have wardrobe, but there is space enough in front of the the bed or in the room\u2019s corridor to store your baggage (note that we carried two massive cases and handluggage!), so for us this was not an issue. The bathroom is also small, but practical and absolutely spotless. There is a little basket with loads of complimentary stuff such as shaving foam, aftershave lotions, bath salts, comb, brushes, toothbrush, toothpaste, headbands, cotton buds\u2026  and if you are missing something, the reception staff brings it to your room in no time. The bath is big enough and the flow of water in the shower is great, particularly after a long day walking around the city.  The bed was of a decent size keeping in consideration Japanese\u2019s bed standards. I had read reviews of hotels where the beds were really tiny. This is not the case in this hotel, where the two of us slept comfortably without bothering each other. Something I really liked was that the hotel provides a typical Japanese kimono/pyjama for you to use. It\u2019s a nice gesture and gets you into their culture a bit; we found it fun to get them on.   The room temperature can be regulated with a very easy to use thermostat located on the wall. I had read reviews of American tourists who found the air conditioned not good enough in Japanese hotels. We visited in winter, so I cannot comment on air conditioning as we made use of the heating; it worked fantastically leaving our room warm and lovely.   The TV choice is not great, but you can purchase a TV card for films and stuff on demand. In the floor\u2019s corridor there was also a self-service drinks dispenser and ice. Here is where you can also buy the TV on demand cards. The prices of the drinks are the same as the convenient store or the vending machines on the street, so it is good to see that the hotel do not take advantage of the service increasing the prices of the drinks.   The room has safe to store your money, jewellery and documentation if needed. It also has a small fridge although I can\u2019t remember if it had any drinks in it. There is also a kettle and a choice of complimentary teas and coffee. Every day they also put a couple of little bags of Japanese snacks that we found nice to eat during midday.   Although we stayed in the tallest of the possible floors, the view wasn\u2019t anything special. Again, this did not bother us at all, as we used the hotel simply to sleep and rest, and we spent all the time in the city out and about.   WIFI is available and for free. Its speed and signal strength is well above standard. We did not stream music or films, but we were using chatting apps to catch up with friends and family and it worked absolutely fine. We also sent a few photos and checked email with no hassle at all.   We can\u2019t comment on the breakfast as we didn\u2019t combine our room reservation with it. Instead we had breakfast on a Starbucks located literally 200 meters far from the hotel\u2019s door. However the breakfast area on the 15th floor (next to the reception) looks fine.   Check-out is at 11 am. The hotel asks you to return the card/keys of your room or you will be charged for them. Our flight out of Tokyo wasn\u2019t until 23:00hrs so we asked the reception staff to look after our baggage, which they did for free and without any hassle, problem or hesitation (we did read some reviews of other hotels being funny about this, or even charging for leaving the baggage in reception, hence why we think is worth mentioning).  Overall, a very pleasant and relaxing stay in a top hotel with a very reasonable rate per night.", "\u2026", "This was a great hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel if it is your first trip to Japan.  It is very attentive to foreign travelers.  For example, there is a pamphlet that explains how to wear the Yukata and slippers and all kinds of other helpful advice I wish I had known earlier in our trip.  The check in is on the 15th floor.  The staff was super attentive and all we dealt with could speak English.  They had excellent maps of the city and were helpful to tell us how to get to the subway station and other parts of Tokyo.  Grab the foldout map of Tokyo they provide, there are good and easy Japanese words to help you on your trip.  The room we had was very spacious even with three people.

The Daimaru department store is located across the road at the Yaesu North exit of Tokyo Station, and has the amazing food hall in the basement as well as excellent cafes on almost every floor, and the 12th and 13th floors have numerous very good restaurants that are open until late at night.

There's only one element we'd have loved to see a little bit better.  Location:  2 minute walk to Tokyo Central Station Yaesu entrances. Also only a 5 minute walk to get into the middle of Ginza, where you can do nice sightseeing stuff and go shopping.  Room: Some may find hotel rooms in Tokyo small, but not the Forus B room, in our opinion. They're not particularly big, but very nicely and practically arranged and furnished. The bed \"experience\" is fun and relaxing, having a wake up system with light, music and vibrations. The shower area is very nice, spacious, luxurious (waterfall shower), and pretty much sound proof.", " There's no bath, but we prefer showers in hotel rooms anyway, so it was perfect for us. The photos on the hotel website give a good impression of the Forus rooms.  Amenities: The Nespresso coffee maker is such a nice extra, as is the melodious water cooker ;) There's also a small refrigerator. Every day four 500ml water bottles were made available, and tea bags and coffee cups were restocked. While we were there, every day a postcard from an art collection was made available which the hotel staff posted for us at no cost for postage. The only thing we would have liked in the room would be a safe to store stuff while we went out. We loved the Japanese pyjamas and kimono, which we  wore every day when we got \"home\" and were replaced every morning when the room was done. We would have been just as happy to have used the same set all days of our stay, but it did indeed feel very luxurious to have clean ones every day. The free wifi was fast.  Soundproof: As the hotel website states, the Forus B rooms are sound proof. Ours was indeed, we were very pleasantly surprised by it. To be in the middle of such a hectic city with the traffic and all, it was very quiet. We also did not hear anything from other hotel guests at any point. Perfection.  OK, so one little point of improvement we think would have made our stay more perfect than perfect: if all of the staff at the reception desk would speak a decent amount of English. Some did, but some could hardly put a sentence in English together and that is something we would have expected at a hotel we think receives many international guests.  Other wise, if you wish to be near the train station and also near shops and touristy things and you like the feeling of being pampered: this really is the place to go!", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": ["Quiet", "Business"], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "1521", "attractions_nearby": "154", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["Dining bars", "Japanese", "Japanese", "Italian"], "restaurants": [{"name": "Sake to Koshitsu Izakaya Maguro Daihyo-dan ta Daihyo", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "6 reviews"}, {"name": "Maple", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Koujigura Yaesu 1-Chome", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Amato Amato", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Sagaken Mitsusemura Fumoto Akadori, Yaesu", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Rose & Crown Yaesu 1-Chome", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shabu Shabu Yakiniku Tabehoudai Merino Ginza", "cusines": ["", "Japanese Fusion", "Dining bars", "Japanese", "Barbecue", "Asian", "Medicinal foods", "Bar"], "reviews": "76 reviews"}, {"name": "Nanatsuboshi", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Hanagoyomi Tokyo", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nadaman at Shangri-La Tokyo", "cusines": [", ", ", Kaiseki ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yomoda Soba Nihonbashi Honten", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "The Lobby Lounge", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Warayakiya Ryoma Dojo Shimbashi Ekimae", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "0 reviews"}, {"name": "Sarabeth's Tokyo", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yabukyu", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yakiniku Yazawa Tokyo", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kamonka Marunouchi Trust Tower", "cusines": [", Beijing cuisine ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sukhumvit Soi Thong Lo Tokyo Yaesu", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Ginza 300 Bar Next", "cusines": ["", "Pub", "Bar", "Brew Pub"], "reviews": "279 reviews"}, {"name": "Nihombashi Otako Honten", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Din Tai Fung Tokyo Station Yaesu Entrance", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Tsujita Nihonbashiyaezu", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Jasmine Thai Yaesu", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Hashimoto", "cusines": [", Kappo ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nazuki", "cusines": ["", "Japanese", "Seafood"], "reviews": "11 reviews"}, {"name": "Master's Dream House", "cusines": [" Pub, Beer restaurants "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kappo Shimamura", "cusines": [", Kappo ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Bar of Tokyo Manouchi Trust Tower", "cusines": [" Brew Pub, Pub, Dining bars, Beer restaurants "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Tai Kou Rou, Tokyo Honten", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yamaya, Nihonbashi", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Bar Yu-Nagi", "cusines": ["", "Pub", "Bar", "Dining bars"], "reviews": "2 reviews"}, {"name": "Hantejiya Yaesu", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Fukube", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Jijibaba", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Uogashi Nihonichi Yaesunakadori", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Hanamaru Udon Nihombashi Eitaidori", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Masaya Shimbashi Store", "cusines": [], "reviews": "0 reviews"}]},

There were a few foreign guests, but the overwhelming majority of guests at the hotel are Japanese. The hotel was kept clean, even at the busiest of times, and I really enjoyed my stay.

A few of the guests can be noisy and inconsiderate, so the earplugs in the capsules are a real plus. Despite the noise, I slept very well indeed.   There are lots of places to eat around the hotel and the staff can give you recommendations too. There's a supermarket one street over if you want to buy food and snacks to take home. I took home several bottles of sake since they can be imported into Hong Kong tax-free.   All in all, an excellent stay and I'd gladly stay there again. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and enjoyed the sake and shochu available at the bar. On my first night, I asked for a few of the accompanying dishes with my sake and since it was already late, I got them gratis and was told to enjoy my stay! The little dishes were lovely.  Note that the hotel does get busy and if you want one of the fancy special pillows, get one early. The same goes for breakfast; one morning I got up there half an hour before breakfast was over and literally had to scrape the pot for leftover curry. All of the hardboiled eggs were gone too. I wake up with low blood sugar, so I need to eat before I get moving or I'm uncomfortable until I get food in my belly.

The shared showers and lavatories are also fantastically clean, but there are only two showers for two floors. There is a washing machine and microwave. The owner speaks a little English. The only downside of this place is it has a strict curfew, I arrived from the UK at 10.30 and could not get there for 11.30 (the cut off time) so had to pay but spend the night at the airport", "I really loved Fukusen and my small and clean room with futon bed and rice pillow. You get free tea and hot water, the showers are good and there is a microwave in the lobby. But best of all was the staff \u2013 all of them. They were so warm and smiley all the time. They learned some words in Swedish which was really cute, and they always welcomed me with big smiles. When I left after six days, the two receptionists and the cleaning lady followed me to outside, waving goodbye until I couldn't see them anymore. They definitely have a piece of my Tokyo heart. The area is ok. There are a bunch of restaurants, convenient stores etc. All the people I met in the area was super friendly and much more social and curious than they are in the city centre.

Clean hotel, maybe too close to the rails so maybe ask for a quite room. I had one. The owners, a couple i believe, are super super nice. Just choose Fukusen! ", "Environment: Minami senju is a small residential area but it is quite perfect if you want to have a good nights rest. The Hibiya line where Minami senju is located, is really convenient because it's just one ride to great stops like Ueno, Akihabara, Roponggi, Ginza & Tsukiji & Naka-Meguro (for Yokohama). Outside the station, it's quiet and low key. Santouka supermarket is right at the train entrance along with Lawson and McDonalds. Burger King and Dennys several meteres further from the station. There's a cheap ramen place opposite the road. So if you're hungry and want a cheap fast meal, you have options. We had out takeout dinners from Santouka for 200-400\u00a5 which is very cheap. And beside, Fukusen is just a mere 3 mins by foot. Also, if you want a more elevated dining", " experience, you can try Obana for their eel (kabayaki) (best in Tokyo) less than 100m further down from the hotel.  Hotel: its a small family-managed hotel, so please don't compare this to a backpackers' inn. The kind of atmosphere here isone of mutual respect, noise reduction and privacy. Most tenants Ive encountered were out of town businessmen, quiet Asian tourists. No loud brash tourists who loiter in the common room. So expect things to be more like a hotel than a hostel.   Facilities/Rules: The curfew 1130 is manageable, so it's not a deal breaker. We arrive usually 8-10 after a looong day, so it was not an issue. The sento bath was rarely utilized by the tenants so if might have the chance to have it for yourself.  There is no common area to lounge around but they have a computer cubcle if you need to surf. Besides if you have a tab + fast hotel wifi, you can surf in your room. The two showers have great pressure, easy & fast temp control and the place is clean.  No experience of lining for the shower so far.  Each floor has a ref and a microwave for your food needs. You eat inside your room.  The rooms are SPOTLESS! No graffiti or dustbunnies. It was not claustrophobic to say the least. The A/c was cold. Caveat tho: no elevator. So if you have heavy luggage, I suggest you transfer your cargo piecemeal to the groundfloor and pack it there in the lobby. That is if you don't want to experience the joys of an herniated disc. Also, the traintracks are near the hotel so you might be disturbed by the sounds. Trains stop 12am. Lastly, doors open 5am but i think reception opens at 8am tho.  Staff/service: the staff were courteous and hospitable. They gave us directions to Obana, had small conversations on Tagalog equivalents of daily expressions, lent us an umbrella when we arrived early for check in, brought our luggages to our rooms while we were away, cleaned our rooms daily, provided us w/ towels and yukata. Overall, just like any other hotel but on a smaller but more intimate scale.  Pricepoint: Cheap! Consider the location, service and amenities...

Well organized area in front of reception area to store your luggage.  Clean room.  Bathroom is small.  Maybe 25% larger than bathroom on cruise ship.

Like all Tokyo hotels, price is pretty steep but what you are paying for is the convenience.   This was literally one of the smallest hotels I have stayed in (comparable to room size and price of Singapore hotels). Once you open the door to your room, there is a bathroom to your right and the bed which pretty much occupies the entire room. The walking space inside the room is negligible so avoid bringing large luggage as this will be difficult to open and will just eat up room space.   The room has a large flat screen TV (this is Japan so I would expect nothing less than modern conveniences :) which is probably the best part, but I dont think I noticed any English channels.   The worst part about the", " room was the smell of the bathroom. It smelled like urine even if we had just arrived and havent even used it. Even after the help cleaned the room, the smell of urine stayed. I am not sure if it has something to do with the material of the toilet. They have a deodorizing spray but it does nothing to help.   There are toiletries available in the bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, liquid body soap) and they also have other items like shavers, hair ties, hair caps, toothbrushes.

The main reason and what I do like about the hotel is the onsen.  It is not very easy to get an onsen hotel in Tokyo.  Unfortunately, the room given to me, when I turned on the aircon had the smell of cigarettes.  Though it was a non-smoking room and floor.  Fortunately, the staff arranged for me to change rooms within the same floor.  But because of the \"unfortunate event\" the staff asked me to check the aircon vent.  That is when I saw how filthy it was.  Granted that I do not normally check the aircon vents in the hotels, I stay in.  This was was really bad, I asked the hotel to clean it the next day when I was out; I am sure they did.  But hope they will not wait till", " we complain to clean the aircon filters and vents.

There is a seven eleven, Matsuya beef bowl shop and Family Marts and lots of restaurants in the area.  The room is a typical Japanese standard of cleanliness and tidiness.

Despite its name, this is not really a ryokan aside from the fairly traditional Japanese theme to the rooms. The beds are contemporary mattresses (just on the floor). This is OK as I wasn't looking for a traditional ryokan. But just be advised if you're looking for the traditional ryokan experience, you should stay elsewhere. This is much more like a hotel with a traditional Japanese twist to it. It's really one part spa-hotel,", " one part ryokan, and one part modern hotel.  Pros: All the above. Very good value for the price. The bathtub was in traditional Japanese style. They provide free water and plenty of different toiletries.   Cons: Inconvenient location (this was the major downside) -- it is about a 15 minute walk to the nearest station, which isn't covered by your Tokyo Metro or Toei passes, so expect to pay a bit more for transportation into the city. It is also a bit of a walk to the nearest convenient store. My room had shutters on the window, which may be nice for people who want to sleep late, but they completely shut out the light altogether (it was pitch black in my room at 8am). The maid service comes by pretty early in the morning. There's no \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Clean Now\" signs to put on your door handle, so you either need to be out at 9am or your room won't be cleaned. The TV is really nice, but the channels and movies on demand are only in Japanese, so I didn't really get to enjoy it. They should offer some English options, in my opinion. They do have a BluRay player attached to the TV, so if they had a library of English-language BluRay disks downstairs, that would solve the problem.  Overall, I'm glad I stayed here.

Also the place is cute!", "My friend and I chose the Hop Step Inn as we really wanted a private room and for as much as we'd pay to share a dorm we were able to get a room here. We reasoned that the price was because it was a bit out of town, however in Tokyo that's not an issue as you're likely to use public transport a lot anyway.  We arrived and they were friendly and hospitable (my friend speaks great Japanese but they spoke great English) and when we asked to change rooms (we were given a double but wanted a twin) they were happy to just give us another room key.  It was clean, quiet and unlike many other hostels came with all the extras you'd more often associate with a hotel (free toiletries, regularly cleaned bedsheets and replaced towels etc).   It's so easy to find, right next to Oji station (5", " minute walk) and with a 7/11, bars, cafes, restaurants etc all within as treet or two, you can't complain about the location.  Checking out was also the easiest it could be. I handed in the key card and got my deposit back.  Honest, well run, good value hostel. Can't recommend it highly enough", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": ["Budget"], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "256", "attractions_nearby": "17", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "86", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Fast food"]},

Great pool, bar / lounge and set Western breakfast that was amazing. Highly recommend.", "We had a wonderful family staycation at the edition this past weekend. Anshul and his team took care of everything we needed to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday. He made sure we had the perfect room to have our room service dinner celebration and also the private dining room for lunch the next day.  We had a couple friends join us for lunch and they made sure that all seats were 6 feet apart, socially distanced and everyone felt safe. On top of it all, the food was fabulous and service was excellent.   Thank you again to the edition for helping us plan a perfect covid safe birthday!", "Had a great stay at the Edition. From the warm welcome by Sayaka san and Ikuko san when we arrived at the hotel to the superb room. I arrived too late to try their restaurant for dinner but i had very delicious desserts with Room Service. Breakfast and lunch at the bar were also very pleasant despite the hotel being very busy. Thank you to Akon san, Yoshiki san, Saito san, Wakana san and Hoshi san for their care.   We will definitely be back!", "Had Brunch on a Sunday there - was a fantastic experience. Relaxing atmosphere, contemporary yet slightly extravagant interiors, extra attentive staff, and the food was plenty and soooo yummy. Will definitely go there again.", "Unique and luxurious boutique hotel, with a buzzy vibe and eye-catching ambiance. The views of the Tokyo Tower will stun locals and visitors alike, and the modern amenities and room appointments will suit even the most fastidious of travelers. Opened in October 2020, the spaces still feel especially fresh and new - and the mix of customers ranges from hip scene-hunting locals and influencers, to families looking for a high-end experience all around. If you read no further, know this is a must-stay hotel in Tokyo. It was a cheekier version of The RC - approachable but luxe. My family and I stayed just two nights, over the New Years holiday week - looking for a special \u201cstaycation\u201d experience in our hometown. Wow. The Edition\u2019s beautiful lobby embodies the exact words of it\u2019s", " architect: a frame of nature. I\u2019ve never seen such a space! The bountiful foliage is expertly maintained, and each unique seating area is exquisitely designed (from furs/pillows/blankets on couches, to rich wood tables with intricate tealights and flowers - like you\u2019ve just walked into a wealthy friend\u2019s insanely decorated home.) The maintenance alone of this space is proof that the operations team is on their game. Walk closer to the window and you\u2019ll recognize why everyone has their camera out - the Tokyo Bay and Tower just a few blocks away are mesmerizing. While check-in was slower than expected, the team working the front desk and lobby were beyond polite and helpful. The rooms are modern, spacious - and white. All elevating the experience to feel fresh, new, and like you\u2019re the first person to use the space. The elegant wood paneling evokes Japanese design mixed with some sexy function, allowing you to peek between the bathroom and sleeping areas. Le Labo NYC products are generous (and fragrant), and together weave the scent story of the entire hotel. We ordered room service (wine and dessert) and it was prompt, delicious, and it\u2019s tough to deliver ice cream without it melting! Our dinner the first night was set-up by the concierge at our request: yakiniku. Not only did this wonderful woman make calls on our behalf to obtain a reservation last minute, but she walked with us all the way to the street level from the hotel. I say this because this included at least 5 minutes outside, and in nearly 0 degree temperatures. Completely unnecessary, but so thoughtful to ensure we wouldn\u2019t get lost on our way. Breakfast service in the Blue Room was a delight. The service was attentive (our server had fresh coffees at the ready before we even asked), and thoughtful in presentation. A limited menu was executed perfectly, well-timed coursing and more than ample portions. In particular, the kids raved about their waffles and pancakes for days after (I feel like the fresh whipped cream may have been a positive factor). Glassware was intentionally selected, and my mimosa was served icy cold. The pool is small, but beautifully maintained. It requires advance reservations (covid-related restriction), and it\u2019s a popular amenity so do your best to book early! We were a little disappointed to learn of this fact after we were suited up and ready to swim, but when we brought this to the hotel\u2019s attention directly - they were extremely apologetic and we had no further issues. Given the reservation system, you get the pool all to yourself once you arrive which turned out to be a lovely treat afterall. The spa is exquisite. My husband and I booked shared services, and had a large room for his massage and my facial. A customary foot wash was performed prior to each service. Days later my skin still feels like perfection, and my husband couldn\u2019t stop talking about his massage. We felt like the only guests in the spa at the time, even though I\u2019m sure this wasn\u2019t the case. We never once felt rushed or like we needed to do anything but fully relax and soak it all in. I\u2019ve spent years of my life in hotels, and can tell you that this one makes the top 10.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": "32231", "best_price_source": "EDITION", "restraunts_nearby": "268", "attractions_nearby": "46", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "99", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Steakhouse", "French", "Bar"], "restaurants": [{"name": "La Gioconda", "cusines": ["", "Tuscan", "Central-Italian", "Italian"], "reviews": "21 reviews"}, {"name": "Lobby Bar", "cusines": [" Bar, ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "The Blue Room", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Schmatz Beer Stand Tokyo World Gate", "cusines": [" Brew Pub, Pub, Beer restaurants, ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "The Jade Room + Garden Terrace", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Gold Bar At Edition", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Sake to Koshitsu Izakaya Maguro Daihyo-dan ta Daihyo", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "6 reviews"}, {"name": "Nobu Tokyo", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Restaurant Voie Lactee", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Ikinari Steak Kamiyacho", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Le Bar a Vin 52 Azabu Toko Kamiyacho", "cusines": [" Wine Bar "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Vegi&Fish", "cusines": [", Pub ", ", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Bifteck Kawamura Roppongi branch", "cusines": ["", "Grill"], "reviews": "24 reviews"}, {"name": "Kyubay", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Toriyaki Toritomo", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Echigoya Gempaku Sohonzan", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Doutor Coffee Shop Kamiya-Cho", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Gotetsu", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shabu Shabu Yakiniku Tabehoudai Merino Ginza", "cusines": ["", "Japanese Fusion", "Dining bars", "Japanese", "Barbecue", "Asian", "Medicinal foods", "Bar"], "reviews": "76 reviews"}, {"name": "Yakitori Banban", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Pronto Il Bar Kamiyacho", "cusines": [" Pub, Gastropub "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Jonathan's Kamiyacho", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nakau Kamiyacho", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Change", "cusines": [" Bar, Pub "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nazuki", "cusines": ["", "Japanese", "Seafood"], "reviews": "11 reviews"}, {"name": "Honeybaked Ham", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Midoriya", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kitchen Dada", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Chimaya", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Komoriya", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Nakamigawa", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "1 reviews"}, {"name": "Sukiya Toranomon 4chome", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "les cacaos Toranomon", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Indian Nepalese Restaurant Saino", "cusines": [", Nepalese ", ", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Cake Papa", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Moyan Curry Toranomon", "cusines": [" Japanese Fusion "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Emmado Akasaka", "cusines": ["", "Chinese"], "reviews": "7 reviews"}]},

It was loads of fun :)  You can try on a yukata for free and they will take a polaroid photo for you to keep. There were at least 6 styles to choose from. I didn't know they had this service, so it was a real surprise to me and Kaoru helped me with putting the yukata on properly.  They gave me a map to explore Tokyo, which was very helpful.  This hostel has 3/4 bed dorms, unlike other hostels in Tokyo that has 30 beds in 1 room.   The hostel is about 20mins walk from Shinjuku station and about 5mins from Yotsuya Sanchome. It is very close to Shinjuku", " National Garden and Jinju Icho Namiki Avenue, where the gingko trees are now at its peak. There are many convenient stores and a supermarket nearly where you can buy food and use their kitchen to cook.  Despite its central location, I was able to get decent sleep and I didn't even use my ear plugs. This is a brand new hostel, so everything was clean and tidy.

The room is a good size for two people, we had enough space for four suitcases and al the stuff we bought over the month we stayed there. The utilities are also good, the room has a air-conditioner that can make the room nice and cold fast, good for the hot summers. (Also has a heater for the winter months). There is also WiFi that reaches the rooms which was really great to have.  In Yoshida house there are also a few long-time stayers which was very nice because they know the area and are fun people to talk with.  The shower, washing machine, kitchen and refrigerator are things you share with the other residents. I myself had no problems with it. You can lock the laundry room which is connected to the", " shower so you have enough space and privacy to change clothing.  The washing machine cost 200yen to use and the washing powder is free.  The refrigerator is big but you share it with a lot of people so groceries have to be done on a daily basis, which is not that bad because I went out everyday and on the way to the station are two convenient stores and a super market. There is also a convenient store less than a minute walk from Yoshida house, very handy for a late night snack.  The location is also good in my opinion. 15 minutes walk to the station and it is Tokyo so there is a train every 10 minutes or so. With the express train you are within 10 minutes in Ikebukuro and from there you can go everywhere with the JR lines.  I'm very happy about my month stay at Yoshida House, had a lot of fun there and met great people.  A quick summarization of all the utilities you get: -airco -new toothbrushes -WiFi (that reaches the rooms) -soap -Cotton swabs -Slippers (more like crocs) -Towels -Kitchen with refrigerator (Shared) -Shared shower (Big shower) -Washing machine (shared)  Thanks for everything Hiki (Owner) :)", "\u2026", "If you're looking for a peaceful, cosy, old-Japan type of communal living experience with friendly, eclectic people, look no further! I recently spent three months at Yoshida, and would highly recommend the spot. I loved the sacred garden outside my room and ease of living in a quiet suburb not far from Central Tokyo. The housemates are respectful and always changing...artists, travelers, families, students and more! I especially loved the warmth and kindness of Yoshida Manager Hikki. No complaints here.", "I've stayed at Yoshida House every year for a month at a time for the past 4 years and I absolutely adore it. It really has become a home away from home for me. The manager of the house, Hikari-san is such an incredibly nice person and will go out of her way to make sure you have a good experience. There are always many other very friendly guests, most of who are long-term residents who are also very friendly and helpful. They are always willing to share tips and stories and during the summer months they sometimes have potluck style gatherings and everyone is invited! The rooms are good sized, double rooms are large enough for multiple people, and single rooms are the perfect size for the solo traveler. There is a fully functional kitchen available to use in the common room, as", " well as a communal computer and cable tv, but the best part is the free wifi! Outside is a nice little garden area, perfect for sitting outside for a chat and a beer with friends. The location might seem a little out of the way, but an express train takes less than 15 minutes to get to the bustling Ikebukuro station, and from there it's easy to get to literally any point in Tokyo via the Yamanote line. Oizumigakuen is a nice location on it's own, with plenty to do around Yoshida House. There's a very nice temple, as well as a river that runs through town. There are many nice opportunities for good walks or bike rides around town. There's also quite a bit of shopping and restaurants, especially around the station. A couple tips I'd have for travelers staying here would be to bring your own towel, book double rooms early (especially in summer time) and most of all DON'T BE SHY!! Talk to the other guests and to Hikari-san, they often know about interesting activities taking place around town and sights to see, things that your travel books don't tell you about (like local festivals!) The price of the rooms are what keep me coming back to Yoshida House, but the atmosphere and the people are what make me homesick for this place for the other 11 months of the year while I'm back home.", "\u2026", "I would like to start off by saying that the strange guests mentioned in previous reviews have all gone now. It's just quiet polite young Japanese people staying here now... and me. (^-^)  I have been coming to Yoshida House on and off for 2 years now and I have to say it's an absolutely fantastic place to stay. It is located in a quiet part of Tokyo in a really cute little town called Oizumi Gakuen and it's only a 20 minute train ride to Ikebukuro (one of the major cities) with trains coming every few minutes. There is also a lot to see and do in Oizumi and a beautiful little temple right next to Yoshida House that I like to visit sometimes.   Yoshida House is now under new management and the new owner Hikari-san is really lovely and friendly and has done a fantastic job of", " renewing this place. She is here almost everday now working hard to make Yoshida House a comfortable and pleasant environment for it's guests. There is also a beautiful garden outside that has just had lots of new plants planted in it, it's such a nice place to sit outside and relax in the summer (when it's not the rainy season (^^) ).  The kitchen is good to with everything you could possibly need and the best bit...free tea! (*^^)v  Another thing about Yoshida House which is definitely worth mentioning is that apart from being very affordable, unlike most guest houses there are no deposits to pay, no contracts to sign, and no strict rules to follow (apart from the obvious 'be respectful to other guests and clean up after yourself!).  I've gotta say that it was a bit strange before when all those weird people were here but now they're gone for good (most of them were quite elderly and have moved on with their lives to other places now), all in all I don't have a bad word to say about this place and always recommend it to anyone who asks me about places to stay in Tokyo! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "251", "attractions_nearby": "9", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "56", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Cafe", "Cafe", "Japanese"], "restaurants": [{"name": "Teuchisobamitaka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Anrakuteiooizumi", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Trento", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Torishin", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Boulangerie TapTap", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Teuchisobamuraki", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kojimaya Tofu Shop", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Chukasoba Ibuki", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Monjayakiokonomiyaki Warabe", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Viva Paella Oizumi Gakuen", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Italian Kitchen VANSAN Oizumigakuen", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Tonkatsu Tashutasai Jizo", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Teuchi Udon Hasegawa", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Vegetables Sommelier Shop Legume", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Kinen", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yaruzo Donmaru Oizumigakuen South Entrance", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Miyabitoju Ando", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Enoteca Lione", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sushidokoro Marutatsu", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Senmi Gyoza", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Starbucks Coffee Oizumigakuen Yumeria Fente", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Marufuku", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Umenohana Oizumi Gakuen", "cusines": [", Kaiseki ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yakiniku Noppo", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Gust Oizumigakuen", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Suzuki", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Lemon Heart", "cusines": [" Bar, Pub "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yamasei", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "31 Ice Cream Yumeria Fuente Oizumi", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sushi-Dokoro Marutatsu Yumeria", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}]},

The location is ok, walking distance to the subway. The public place is tiny and the whole place is stuffy because of the air ventilation. sometimes it was hard to bear as some guests spent the whole day outside, when they were back to the hostel, they just went to bed without having a shower or washed their feet, so the smell was unbearable in such a tiny space. The air-con was turned on very late in the evening and turned off early in the morning. The lady (the owner?) walked here and there at least twenty times ,passing our sleeping place in the early morning. So it was hard to have a good rest.  We couldn't sleep well during our stay at all.", "The concept is good, but zero public space, no air-ventilation, place is stinks. It could have been nicer. The place is sealed, so no air-ventilation. In the morning, when they clean the place, they open the window, but later on when all the people arrive, they take off the shoes inside the same room they sleep, so you can try to imagine : more then 20 people sleep in the same room, all their shoes are there in the open and no no air-ventilation... There is no public space to sit anywhere. The very small area that is designated as such, is full of the bags of the people who stay there.  Staff is nice and friendly.

One room had a bath and shower and the other just a shower. The rooms are small but comfortable. We had 3 suitcases in 1 room but they fit ok.  One of the things to note is that the doors to the rooms are outside similar to motels in the US. There was an elevator to the upper floors. The toilet is in its own tiny room/closet and the shower/bath is in another room. I think for us, the shower worked out better than the bath since we took a shower in the bath anyway, and in the room with the bath, the shower is supposed to be used on the floor rather than the", " bathtub so it was a little awkward showering in the bathtub. Great water pressure though and the heated toilet was very nice.   We arrived around 10:30am and checked in but our room wasn't ready. The hotel was happy to store our luggage while we went out.

I loved being able to explore the neighborhood without the craziness of main Tokyo areas.  The room is small so be prepared and pack light. Other guests can be heard a bit but nothing out of the ordinary.

There is also a 3rd floor with another dorm room. My family stayed in the private room which has a queen size bed and a full size traditional futon.

We didn't have lunch or dinner near the hostel but there are numerous places. We did use the bar one night and it was an enjoyable experience. Our only negative was that other guests used the hairdryer outside our door at 5am 2 days in a row. The rooms aren't sound proof but ear plugs are provided. That was the only noise problem.

We met other lovely people from Aus, Germany and USA. The staff were v friendly, the location was unbelievable, 2 mins from the train station. 1 min down the road is one of the best izakayas in Tokyo, vintage stores and amazing Okonomiyaki! .

The cleaning service was not only poor but after our first complaints deliberately bad. Other complaints were not or only after repeated requests attended too and the manager in charge of our account was simply rude, arrogant, disrespectful, and close to racist towards my wife. More than that she came with harassing phone calls, threatening emails without any cause. Demanding, not asking payment before the due date. And refusing on 2 occasions to extend our contract even though we kept our commitments. Actually renting the place in the end to other people without asking if we would like to extend. Lucky we did", " not want too as we were fed up with the disrespect and the lies from this manager. Even though they were to blame for our late check-out, not answering my requests for information, they came to the apartment at 18h40, threatened with police and court. Ridiculous behavior. Sumitomo is one of the worlds biggest companies but has basically cheated us out of 4 months of rental because at no time did we receive the advertised service or attention", "\u2026", "The property is a newly- built, 44- floor building with commanding views from the upper floors over the surrounding areas of Tokyo and on the west side, to Mount Fuji. I checked in with a very friendly staff member, who went through the details and showed me to my space, a large (62 square meter) corner suite (Nr. 2002) with bedroom, combo living/ dining room, kitchen, toilet, washroom, laundry room and shower / bath room. The view to the west of Tokyo was fantastic, with a great view of Mt. Fuji on most days.   Room Details and equipment My bed was firm and very comfortable.  My room was quiet and I did not hear a single sound from the neighbors during my 31 days there.  Everything in the space functioned well.  There are four ceiling- mounted aircon / heating units, remote", " controlled, very quiet and effective. The kitchen had a stove with two induction spots and one radiant spot.  There was enough cookware to do most things.  The refrigerator was just the right size for my needs.  There was a microwave, a toaster-oven, a coffee pot and of course a rice cooker.  There are two TVs and a phone / FAX machine.  The internet was fast and reliable. The toilet and bath were in separate rooms, as normal in Japan.  The tub / shower room was quite large and had a wall- length mirror for viewing while seated \u2013 the only catch here was that there was not the usual 12- in high stool to sit on whilst scrubbing before the bath.  The bath had an automatic filling function, with programmable temperature, so you can turn it on and go shave and scrub and it\u2019s ready and waiting when you are ready.  They provide full manuals in English for all the equipment, and there are very thoughtful (and small!) labels in English for the washer/dryer setting buttons and other appliance controls.  There are individual control units for the maximum faucet water temperature in the kitchen, washroom and shower / tub. There is a sort- of balcony, the fire escape in fact, but you can open the door for fresh air and step out of you wish \u2013 but it is not a have- a- glass- of- wine- and- look- at- the- city kind of a space. My only wish was that the lighting were brighter, especially since the desk lamp did not work. Location The building is very near the Hilton and Hyatt Regency hotels and across from the Shinjuku Central Park.  The nearest Metro stations are the Marinouchi Line\u2019s Nishi- Shinjuku station and the Toei Line\u2019s Tochomae and Shinjuku 5-Chome stations. They are all very convenient, seven or so walking minutes, and the JR, Odakyu and Keio train lines at Shinjuku Eki, the world\u2019s busiest train station, are a 12- minute walk from the site.  The Narita Express train provides service to Shinjuku Station, and Haneda Airport is reached by taking one of two paths: Monorail and Toei Oedo subway, connecting at Hamamatsuchou / Daimon, or the JR Yamanote Line and Keikyu Rail Line, connecting at Shinagawa Station. La Tour runs a free shuttle bus which runs frequently to Shinjuku Station. The environs include numerous small, local restaurants, some really good ones at that; good grocers for those who wish to cook on their own; and small- street neighborhoods to explore, all in addition to the well- known and nearby Shinjuku high- rise experience. Security You have to have your secure key to get into the elevator lobby, and then once you are on the lift, you cannot get to your floor unless you tap your secure key Fob to the floor selection panel -- so overall, the security is really good. Amenities There\u2019s a health club, a theatre and a kids room on the third floor overlooking the Shinjuku Central Park in front, a rare luxury in urban canyon Shinjuku.  There\u2019s a \u201csky lounge\u201d as well.  If you rent a bicycle for a period of time, there\u2019s assigned indoor cycle parking available, only accessible with your secure key fob, a real plus for the Shinjuku area which is cracking down on random bike- parkers. Service The maid service was good, the maids were friendly and efficient and kept the room spotlessly clean.  The front desk staff were very helpful and on duty 24 hours, with adequate English capability.  Sumitomo Realty manages the property and were excellent to work with. Check- out was a snap, just hand in the key and off you go.

We arrived from Osaka via Narita and it was raining hard when we got out of the Tokyo City Air Terminal station in Ningyocho. Had a hard time finding the Inn because of the rain but we finally did.

Like most of Tokyo, the area is safe and clean.  If you know EXACTLY where you're going, the location is not all that bad.  It's about a 15-minute walk to Sensoji Temple, lots of stores and the Metro but you need a treasure map to find it.  I walked there many times during my stay and even using a smartphone GPS app, it's difficult to find without making at least one or two wrong turns.  There were two chain convenience stores within a few blocks.   Most everything else was a decent walk.    The lobby is up one level and the desk is not staffed 24 hours though I believe staff can be reached at any time.  They were friendly and spoke some English.  There is an elevator.  Room had a bed, desk, window with", " somewhat of a view, old fridge, old microwave (that was malfunctioning) and a TV with few channels, all Japanese.   Bed was fairly comfy though bedding was only an undersized comforter.  A/C worked OK.  WiFi was OK.  Furnishings were old but room was fairly clean.  Bathroom had a small but deep shower/tub.  Could have been a little cleaner.  Toiletries included a toothbrush and razor.  Lights worked.  You had to lock the door with a key when you left which was not convenient or very safe as I suspect many people think hotel doors lock behind them, even if they aren't deadbolted.  For a city short on space and where many businessmen sleep in capsules, this definitely was a good deal.  I would always sacrifice location for space.", "\u2026", "I wouldn't call this a hotel in the strictest sense of the word. More like an apartment or a mid-range condominium.  The location is far from Minowa station and it took us a kilometer of walking just to reach the place. And that is just what we did everytime we took to the streets of Tokyo. Although at the tail end of our trip we discovered that it was more convenient but expensive to get off at Asakusa Station and take a taxi to the hotel.  The lobby is at the second floor and can be accessed through the stairs so you need to lug your luggage up. The elevator starts at the second floor. The staff can speak English fairly well and very accommodating. The downside is the front desk is closed from 11:00pm to 8:30am. It would be a pity if you would want something from them at that", " time.   The hotel has no restaurant but has a vending machine in the lobby that sells various drinks. A do-it-yourself laundry room is located at the back. A Lawson convenience store is just around the corner. The hotel is far from the busy section of Tokyo and quiet at all times.   The room is small compared to normal hotel standards. It has a double bed which is small for two people. A dresser, a small table for a flat TV, a microwave, small refrigerator, hair dryer, kettle, two glasses and a chair are also in the hotel. A wardrobe is placed beside the toilet but can used only by one person. You put your luggage in one corner of the room where you take your clothes directly from it.  As we were three in the room, we used the comforters of the two other rooms where our companions were staying as an extra bed.   The microwave does not work. The aircon remote is in Japanese, you have to guess the right button, thus controlling the temperature is impossible. The TV was all Japanese shows making the devise useless for us.  Our room was on the fourth floor, with balcony and had a fairly good view of the area.  The small bathroom has cold and hot water with the usual complimentary toiletries. The bathtub takes up most of the space in the bathroom so you have to take a shower in it. After flushing the toilet, you can hear the refilling of the tank and can be disturbing if used at night.  Cleaning of the room and changing of the sheets is done only if requested.   The entire room was clean and the toilet does not smell even after use.  Wifi is fast and can connect fairly quick.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay, although I would not personally want to recommend to others.", "\u2026", "We got this room via hotwire. As we were on a rather tight budget, we opted for a 3* hotel. I had a good experience with hotwire previously and was rather 'disappointed' with this 'hotel'. To be fair, it was not terrible. The room was large (by Japanese standards) and had a polite receptionist (late check in).  But, it is in a very quiet housing area, a long walk to the metro, hard to locate, very basic amenities,, no breakfast/cafe etc.. Like a bland dish, it is tasteless and lacking. Just some place to rest for a night.", "This is absolutely not a hotel !  First of all, the name says this \"hotel\" is in Asakusa. That's totally wrong ! It's located in Senzoku and very far away from any subway station, 20 minutes from Iriya (Hibiya line). To go there with all our luggages was awful. Hopefuly we had wifi with us because I really thought my boyfriend was mistaken as we took very small streets. When you arrive at the Soho, you see the reception is on the 2nd floor... without elevator ! Good luck. And nobody is at the reception, no staff visible. In fact they're all in a room behind the reception and you have to bell if you want to see someone. We wanted to let our luggages at the reception, used then as locket. They don't give you a ticket to get your luggages back unlike normal hotels. You really have", " to trust them. You can keep the key with you when you go outside to visit Tokyo. At the beginning we didn't understand why they decided to do this way. But it was very logical as the reception is open from 8:00am to 11:00pm (cross the fingers if you need help between 11:00pm and 8:00am !). And you are very lucky if you see someone at the frontdesk when the reception is still open. Everybody seems to prefer staying in the other room behind their screens. The staff is not very professionnal but tries to give the impression he is, with his now famous \"hello sir, madam\". No breakfast, so they found a solution : putting in every room a noisy fridge that you'll probably want to throw out from the room, directly in the street. We had to disconnect it as we couldn't sleep. The room has a correct size but is very badly disposed. The bathroom is small and badly disposed as well. The furniture is very tired. All is absolutely not functional and very dusty. There is mold in the bathroom. Talking about sleeping... our night were awful. The bed was way to small for two, and so was the blanket of course. The one next to the ground has to pray not to fall down during the night. There was a laundry in the hotel : we had to go out, go around the building, and the laundry was there. No clear explanation there so it's not really easy to use it. The first day we discovered that the Soho was really not far from \"hot district\", with clubs.  The second day, 11:00pm, our bed cracked. Quickly and praying, we went to the reception where, luckily, there was still someone. We explained the situation. \"We send you the staff.\" What a staff ! Three men with one hammer, two electric screwdrivers and some wood boards. 11:15pm, the screwdrivers worked in the room and they were fixing the bed. After that, we were always afraid that the bed cracked once again, especially where the bed was moving a lot when we were in.  So as a resume : no services, the room is not comfortable and not functional at all, no presence of the staff unlike the other hotels. The name Soho Asakusa Hotel isn't reflecting the type housing and the district it is located. Reserving in this hotel was an awful mistake that cost us our trip in Tokyo : as we were not rested at all it was very difficult to visit the city.  And I forgot to tell : the air conditioning didn't work as well : when we wanted 30\u00b0C, it was cold getting out of there.", "\u2026", "Small cheap hotel for business trip.

There was a separate toilet and a communal area with sinks and mirrors to wash your hands and brush your teeth. There were hair dryers here too available for use. The shower was lovely and hot and very powerful and I slept very well after experiencing one. I had a quick perusal of the bookshelves and then headed back to my secret room with a few books to read in the privacy of my bed. I pulled the privacy curtains across and that was me all tucked in for the night. I was able to pop out for something to eat and a number code is given for accessing back into the hostel so you are kept safe at all times. The reception appeared to be manned most of the time by an English speaking person too. There were also mini electric fans available for loan for free if you felt your cubby hole got a little too hot.

The only strange thing is that the building is not locked but this is Japan so it is ok. The only we didn't like is that it was a bit cold at the hall and at the toilet area.

Imagine washing your wash in the dark, or wandering across the floor to get to the toilet in the main hallway to find a switch...  None of the rooms have a toilet or sink ensuite. Tissues are not provided either, so bring your own. There's about 7 or so units with only one toilet which is often occupied or dirty. Because the rooms have a balcony access, the owner randomly comes into your room to hang things, which was surprising and inappropriate. Solo females beware!  There's small black marks on the sheets, so check before you go to sleep, as one of my friends were bitten by bug bites.", " Bring some spray for your luggage to make sure they don't come home with you.

The guesthouse is located on top of the restaurant so the noise goes until about midnight. If you're an earlier sleeper, bring earbuds and an eye mask, as there's only some translucent curtains.  Owner didn't seem to be around much other than in the mornings around check out time. Kinda an older rough Korean uncle type that didn't seem too happy.

The first stay was pleasant as we took the Premium Japanese styled suite which could fit the total of 5 of us. Check in was easy as we arrived pretty late at night and the hotel has provided us with the room number as well as the pin code to access the room. The suite was nice with very comfy beds, pillows which were generally clean. The hot shower was very good and bath had a tub as well for an onsen session. Next day met with a reception which marred the experience. This Japanese lady seemd to be in a bad mood. We checked out of our first tranch stay to spend a few nights in Odawara. Hotel had luggage storage so it was really helpful.   The 2nd tranch stay was in another suite ie Executive Suite. Room", " was good but some significant flaws were experienced compared to the first stay. In summary, I am listing out the pros and cons of this place:  Good 1. Suites are large and comfy. 2. There is a guy reception (wears a spectacle - cant remember his name) who was very very nice. He went out of the way in helping us which is a plus point. 3. Near a supermarket (gourmet city) which is open 24 hrs. Great priced beer and groceries. 4. Full facilities provided in the suite. Can heat up food for breakfast or a midnight supper and do your dirty laundry too.  Bad 1. The Japanese lady reception. If the Management team is reading this, she was manning the counter on morning of 30 August. Clearly saw discriminative behaviour towards my family as compared to some europeans. Have never met a Japanese let alone any service industry personnel this bad to be honest. She was outrightly showing displeasure in answering my queries queries.  2. Distance is slightly away from the stations. Need a 5 mins walk at least. 3. Air condition in room 204 was not working well. Had to sleep in the heat. I think someone tried to do something about it but still seemed to be under capacity for a large room. 4. 2nd floor had no lifts. Got to lug the luggages up 2 flight of stairs.

If you answer no in any one of the above questions, I strongly advise you to stay away from this hotel.  There is only one trainee receptionist on desk during day time, and the lady happens to speak very little English, thus communication is a very big issue.  Also there are no receptionist after 11pm, and only night guard available (surprisingly the night guard speaks very fluent English).    The room was very tiny as expected, 10m2 as described on their website, and with windows facing right to the next", " building, where you can literally handshake the neighbor next door.  But the size and communication issues would be the slightest of your problem.  The problem started after I returned to the hotel later that night.  When I was having shower, I started to hear water dripping noise from above the ceiling.  I quickly went down to the reception, but there were only an outsourced night guard on desk.  The night guard quickly acknowledged the problem and stated the noise was coming from the air conditioner, they have received many complaints before, but the hotel was full that night and the engineer have left already, there is nothing he can do.   The noise never stopped during the whole night even if I have turned off the air conditioner  Given the small cubical, the noise appears very loud and echoed through the room, even with the TV turned on.  This has kept me up all night and especially terrible after a red eye flight which I hardly got any rest.   The next morning I went down to the reception but there was no one on desk!  I waited for 15 minutes yet no one showed up.  I left for Ueno and went back at approx 3:15pm and finally the trainee receptionist showed up.   She was aware of the problem, and requested me to stay in the room and wait for the engineer to come and inspect the issue.  I have asked for a specific time the engineer to come, or simply a change of room, but given she speaks little English, she could not understand my message at all, despite repeated attempt of communication through translator apps.  After over 20 mins, I gave up and stayed in the room and wait.  After about 2.5 hours, a manager finally came and opened the servicing door inside the bathroom to fix the issue - he seems to be very experienced at this task.  After about 2 minutes, the issue was fixed.  The manager apologized and acknowledged that the problem was due to the drainage hose coming lose and this happened to many of the room.  At that moment, I was just glad to be able to have a quiet evening of rest and I don't want to drill on the issue anymore, and let him go easily.  Thou that's not the end of the problem, as the noise re-appeared on the 4th night during middle of the night, which I knew the night guard will not do anything about it and I just checked out first thing in the morning.   Clearly the hotel knew about the problem and they didn't do anything to fix it permanently.  Also, if they know there is a quick fix for it, they could have just teach everyone (the trainee, the night guard) to help fix the problem immediately.  Also my cry for help through front desk and even through hotel email were ignored.  This hotel group have permanently been placed on my personal black list.", "\u2026", "My first review was somehow missing? Well I am just very disappointed with this hotel, I will write my full review again, and probably save it in cause it goes missing again.  Stayed in the hotel during July 2016 for over 4 nights, this is the first time I stayed in this hotel group in Japan.  The location was okay if you going around that particular area, but besides Tokyo Skytree, its more of a residential area, so don't expect too much night life.   But before you check in, you must ask yourself if your Japanese is good enough. Also, if you could sleep with constant noises coming from the air condition. If your answer to either one of the above question is no, then I would strongly suggest you to stay away from this hotel.   First of all, I am very familiar with small hotel", " in Tokyo, also never expect any view from the hotel room. The room was 10m2, but their clever design made the room seems bigger than the stated size. But that's the only plus of this hotel.  The reception desk was so tiny and there're only one person on desk at all time, and over half of the time of my stay, the person on desk speaks no English at all! That was not a problem if there is not issue or problem. But that proved a big issue for my stay, the lack of any English knowledge made communicating extremely difficult.  At the check in, the room seems fine - new and clean. But problem started at around 11pm on the first night. During shower, I started to hear some water dripping noise on top of the toilet. I waited for about 20 mins after shower to make sure it was not just a problem of the shower room. However the noises continued, so I headed down to the reception to seek help. At that time the reception have already checked out, and only a night guard is available.  The night guard speaks very fluent English, and quickly acknowledged the problem was due to air conditioner, but as the engineer have already left for the day, there was nothing he can do. When ask for change of room, he refused and said the hotel was fully booked that night. I tried to switch off the air conditioner for over 30 minutes but the sounds continued. So I have to stuck in the room whole night, trying to some sleep with the constant water dripping noise, which is extremely unpleasant after my red-eye flight and long day of activities.   Mind you, the sounds echoes thru the small cubical, making it extremely difficult to ignore, even with the TV turned on to high volume.  The only windows was facing directly to another window on the next building - I can literally open the windows on the other building, so ventilation was extremely poor and I have no option other than keeping the air con on.  (of course unless if you have the option to keep the door opened!)  Next morning I went down to reception at about 10am and found no one on the desk. Waited for 20 mins and I gave up and head out, returning to hotel @ 3pm which I think someone will be available as the check in time starts.   Returning to hotel @ 3:30pm, the reception acknowledged the problem and ask me to stay in the room and wait for the engineer to come and check it. I was very frustrated after a sleepless night, I try to arrange a specific time instead of just stay in the room waiting. The lady, who speaks no English at all, just keeps asking me to wait in room.  After several attempts, I just request directly for a change of room which she refused, even with the hotel over half empty.  After over 30 mins of trying and many attempts with use of google translate, I gave up.  The 'engineer' finally came about 2 hours later.    The 'engineer' (more like a manager?) came in, open the hatch inside the toilet and fiddle with something above the panel, and the noise disappear.  Then he apologies and explained it was due to the air conditioner water drainage pipe went lose, and all the room inside the hotel are designed the same way so it might happen again even if I get a room change.  I wondered if it is such an easy fix, why they don't teach and authorized the other receptionist and even night guard to immediately act on it, instead of asking the client to withstand the noise and wait in the room for the 2 hours waiting?  Exhausted and frustrated, at the time I am just glad the issue is solved and not want to further drill on the issue.    The good quiet night only lasted for 2 nights, during the middle of the 4th night, the noises comes back again.  I immediately checked out and moved to a new hotel for good.    During the stay, I have sent email to the agent and hotel requesting for help, but received no reply.  I understand this could happen to any hotel, but the way they handle it is so unprofessional.

The rooms were very simple but comfortable (just a mattress on the floor and a small rack to hang clothes, along with an air conditioner).

A patio with table and chairs, along with a small burner where our group made curry one night, was just outside. There were a couple of washing machines available for our use -- although we had to hang our clothes out to dry, four floors up a winding staircase, on the rooftop. No matter! There was a \"dumb waiter\" elevator to send the clothes up or down, and the view from the top was spectacular! (Guests frequently made use of this extra outside space to just \"hang out\" and enjoy the fresh air.) What made our stay special, though, was the hosts! We were clearly guests in their home, and they made us feel so welcome. One day my husband and I had a late start and needed to catch up with the rest of our group. The owner generously and graciously loaded us up in his van, along with my husband's wheelchair, and drove us to the best train station to reach them sooner.

The room was clean, but smokey.  As an American and being tired at the end of my trip, I ignored the slippers on the way into the room and didn't use them in the bathroom.  The overwhelming smell of cigarettes was in the air.  I opened the window as wide as it could go to air out the room.  I noticed a little warning saying that the hotel is not responsible for stolen items.  That's fine, but I didn't see that in any other hotel I stayed at in Japan, and it made me think of having my belongings stolen on my last day in Japan.  So what did I do?  I pretty  well stayed in my room all day to make sure my stuff was safe.  Looking back, I was going a little nuts, but", " still.  Anyway, the place was smokey, there were sometimes strange people in the hallways, and I didn't feel fully safe like I did at other (more expensive) hotels.  On the plus side, this place is about a half mile to the nearest JR line and I found a little grocery store nearby.  There is a police box on the corner and the officers were helpful to me when I asked for directions (despite the language barrier).  The bed was comfortable and I think there was a small refrigerator in the room.  There were clean towels in the bathroom.  The lady at the desk was nice (I wish I spoke Japanese though!).

Nobody there spoke english and all signs are in japanese but it wasn't much of a problem.   The front desk guy showed me how to pay for the room with the vending machine which gave me a ticket which I gave back to him.  It was 3800 yen.  You get a little shoe locker, and also a locker for your clothes.  Its not big enough for luggage but I saw luggage being stored behind the front desk so I guess you can take big luggage there if you need to.   The whole place including the capsules were spotlessly clean.  The only thing I didn't like was there were no showers.  You have", " to take a bath with a bunch of japanese guys.  It was the middle of august and really hot outside but the place was nicely air conditioned. There is a lounge area with big comfortable reclining chairs and you can pay less by sleeping on a chair instead of a capsule. The place was great but I don't think I will stay there again because for 3800 yen I want a shower.", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "3441", "attractions_nearby": "218", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Chinese", "Japanese", "Japanese"]},

I took some, because I didn't realize they'd have towels in a small box under the sink.   As for the bathroom and shower, they look new and they looked nice. There is soap and shampoo in the shower room (they have a tub for those inclined), and there is a toothbrush and mouthwash and face/hand soap in the bathroom.   If you are in that area, and you are exhausted and you need a quick place to lie down, I would recommend this place.

We booked this hotel as we are on somewhat on a budget but still wanted to be close to the things we wanted to see. When we were looking around the area can be very expensive so we chose this one mainly because of price.   Prior to our arrival I received an email from the guy that runs the place just asking us our estimated time of arrival as he has a couple of places he runs just to make sure he was there for our arrival, I let him know there were a few things we needed to do at the airport (pick up rail passes, get SIM cards, and just general not knowing how long it would take to get through the airport) so I gave him a rough time, he was fine with that and just said to keep him updated as and", " when I could, so I added his number he gave me on WhatsApp so I could reach him easily. He immediately sent me very detailed photos showing the route from the train station I told him I would be getting off at to his place, which was very useful as I don\u2019t know that a map would have found it easily as it is quite tucked away.   He was lovely on arrival, check in was easy, showed us where everything was. The room was basic but clean, as was the bathroom. Had a good size fridge in the room and air conditioning. It was a bunk bed which I know people have mentioned, which wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem but when you book on booking.com it doesn\u2019t tell you that, nor are there any photos of bunk beds, but it was fine for us.

Check out was easy too, just leave the keys in the room and go.   The accommodation, and the area was quiet and felt very safe. Having never been to Japan or knowing anything about it it was a welcoming place to start our trip and I would definitely return if I was coming back.   A few minutes walk away is a Family Mart small supermarket which is open 24 hour which was useful to us (especially during jet lag and fancying something random in the middle of the night!) it is right outside the station which is dead easy to get around places.

We would take Keisei line to Ueno or Nippori and start using our JR passes from there. Nothing to see or do in the area. The closest station with attractions is Oshiage for Sky tree and from there we walked to Asakusa.

Bathroom was the size of the ones they have on cruise ships, you turn around and hit the walls with your elbows. There was no closet to put your clothes, just 3 hangers and 3 hooks.

So much so, I've already booked to stay again next year.  I booked this hotel at the very last minute, after seeing some bad reviews for the hotel I'd originally booked. I had a few questions, and the staff at Bnb Plus Costelun Akiba got back to me almost immediately.  The location was a little hard to find, but with Google Maps and downloading some location pictures onto my phone as reference, I got there ok. The welcome was one of the warmest I've received in Japan. The staff are friendly, equally happy to speak in Japanese or English, and quick to help with any queries. After I checked out, I was worried I had left something in the hotel. I dropped them an email, and again they got back to me", " straight away so I didn't have to spend my flight worrying about it.  The facilities are basic, as you would expect for a capsule hotel, but they are extremely comfortable. The beds and shower/bath facilities are clean, and there are small storage lockers for valuables. There is room to store suitcases, but I wouldn't recommend bringing a very large case. There are some nice extra touches, such as a hanger in each of the capsules, and toiletries (showergel, shampoo, conditioner) are provided.  The hotel is female-only, so great for a girls' trip or for lone women who want a budget stay but are a little nervous about travelling/staying alone.

Thank you very much Yadoya! I loved it :)", "We stayed here for a couple of nights. It was okay overall. The cleanliness was quite good. The staff are really good with English so it was easy to communicate with them.   The room itself was tiny, though. The space is ridiculously narrow. The 3 of us has to share the room with another traveller, which we know would happen, but there wasn't enough room for our belongings. My friend who was on the top of the bulk bed had to put her 50L hybrid bag on her own bed. Otherwise, we couldn't fit my 10kg bag and another 50L on the floor.   But I've heard that's very common in Tokyo. So what else do I expect?", "The place is very cramped. The dorms are packed with as many bunk beds as possible leaving no available space for guest's luggage which results in climbing over other people's bags to get to the toilet or door.... Good points are convenient location & helpful staff.", "As mentioned before, the staff is awesome, we had some issues with our reservations and they gladly fixed it as best as they could for us.   The first night we didn't have reservation in the main building so they sent us to their long term facility. We expected it to me better than the main building since staff is supposed to live there. Air conditioning isn't free , 100\u00a5  90 min .and our sheets had blood on them.We were wrong. Please see for your self.  We stayed for one night and the next day we booked a hotel for double the price but quadruple the comfort.", "Good things first, the staff was very pleasant when I checked in and out, and I could keep my bags there till I left Tokyo. Thankfully I had a good bunch of people in the room, so at least it wasn't too noisy at night from inside the room. Bad things: It is very close to the train station, but tucked away in an alley, so the first time I was coming to it I got quite lost trying to find it. In terms of the room: I suppose when you book a 16-person room, it's to be expected, but the beds were very close together. I was on a top bunk and there was not enough head space even to crawl on the bed, which made it pretty uncomfortable. My bed was also very close to the balcony and people were smoking on it, so the smell coming in was not pleasant."], "hotel_class": ["Budget"], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "753", "attractions_nearby": "37", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "81", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Japanese", "Japanese"]},

It really is just a very small room with tiny shower(no bathtub) with a bed wedged between two walls so you have to slide to the end to get out of it.  You are lucky to fit two suitcases in the room. There is a feeling of claustrophobia as you cannot lift the blinds and cannot see out of the windows.  The sink is in the room, not the bathroom and cannot be plugged.  There is a microwave, electric kettle and small refrigerator but hardly any space to eat.  There is supposed to be a washing machine but we did not see it or use it.   There is not much of a reception area as you self check-in and we hardly saw anyone at the desk.  But we saw cameras in the reception and elevator.  For a hotel that is advertised as", " just opened in April 2019, the carpet is stained and the overall feel is old.  The plus is that it is located several blocks from the train station and restaurants.  But there are plenty of better places to stay for the same price that are close to transportation and food.  I\u2019m not sure what the other rooms looked like but we won\u2019t stay here again.  ", "\u2026", "This hotel is in a great location near the Akihabara station, surrounded by lots of restaurants and things to see. The staff were very friendly and the room was super clean.   The bathroom was very small, similar to an airplane. However, it got the job done! The walls were also not super sound proof, but this didn\u2019t end up bothering us. Lastly the check out time was very strict. We read it as 10am but it is actually before 10. Right at 10 on the nose we had a knock on our door saying that it was check out time. Thank goodness we were ready.  The check in time is also quite late, at 4pm, which was not super ideal for only a one night stay.   Overall, for a less expensive hotel for this region the experience was very good. Nice clean rooms and lovely staff members.

Yes the lodgings state it is self check in but they don't say there is absolutely no one in attendance at the premises to take luggage, attend to any concerns.

It hadn't a chair or a desk or a closet. what you get is just a large space with a futon and this is it. there is a small table that carries the TV + other amenities and a small fridge underneath but you can use that table as a desk.  That said, I have to highlight that the room was always clean, the bathroom was also very functional & super clean, the staff was courteous and the location is very, very convenient; however for a guy like me (+200 lbs of weight) the futon thing didn't work as it was very thin (not cushion at all) and not having a chair it was weird.", "  Some important things to keep in mind: a) You need to give a deposit in cash (5,000 yens) and it will be refunded when you check out, they don't take credit cards; b) The TV hasn't any offer in English and c) The checkout is at 10 Am  and not at noon like any other hotel.", "\u2026", "This stay was in a great location in Shinjuku!  The downside was the bathroom was extremely small and snug, as was the room, and they only offered stacked Japanese style mattresses as a bed, basically on the floor.  We ended up stacking several mattresses together to make it more comfortable.  It was unlike anywhere we've ever stayed, so I was surprised.  We were there only a couple of days, so we tolerated the sleeping arrangements.  However, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The upside, it was around the corner from lots of shops, restaurants, and the Shinjuku night life.  Had the best Ramen in Japan in this area.  A few grocery shops in the area as well, all walking distance.  Would definitely  stay in this area again. Japan's visit was amazing!

Room was small but acceptable for Tokyo standards. We had a semi double bed and just enough space to open two luggages. Reception was friendly, location was just a stones throw away from the station. There are quite a few eateries at the station too, and a few convenience stores around. It may be a little out from the city centre but definitely still convenient. WIFI was also good.

The bathroom and toliet were not just dirty but DISGUSTING. The owner should understand that there should be maintaned a certain levl of cleanliness otherwise it is not adequate for accommodation.  The bed linen was not clean and fresh as well. I believe that maybe it is changed not after every single guest, we were so much disappointed that we had to sleep without taking off our clothes. The wardrobe in the room was full of owner's personal belongings, so we could not put our things there. I DEFINITELY SUGGEST TO AVOID THIS PLACE.", "This place is disgusting and no where near any cool parts of Tokyo - in fact, it is near nothing at all!! The closest convenience store is 7-Eleven which is a 20 minute walk away. This town has nothing to do, no restaurants or anything at all. The only thing it does have it feral cats roaming and begging around the hostel.   The hostel itself is a dump. The shower is unsanitary. There were chunks of mold growing on the ceiling, in between the cracks of the doors and all over the bathtub- I couldn't believe it I was in absolute shock.    The hostel owner was aggressive. While checking out (which is 10am) we were running behind because we got lost on a train coming back from Shibuya. We were 10 minutes late checking out and he stood at the entrance of the dormitory to watch us", " pack and was yelling at us. We've never had this problem at any other hostel ever.   Overall this place is a big disappointment. I don't know why anyone would ever want to stay here. Apart from the bacteria mold growing toxic and infested hostel itself, it is not close to anything and it's very hard to access any fun parts of the city and train tickets become expensive.   If you are new to traveling Japan, please be advised that the trains do not operate all night either. The trains from the Aoto Station - which is this hostels station stop running at 8pm!!!!. So if you miss the train, the only way home is by taxi and it is very hard to get the taxi to take you the whole way back, let alone a $200 USD fare charge. You do not want to stay this far away from Shibuya, Harijuku or Tokyo. If you can find a place that is an hour walk away for 25 minute subway ride away, that is ideal.   Overall this place is terrible and disgusting. Very very disappointed with our stay here.

He had the nerve to lecture my friends & I about having \"positive\" energy & being \"connective\". All because of a simple miscommunication over the phone between English & Japanese speakers, when asked a question on how much it would be to cancel reservations (because we might of had to leave early to go home to Osaka) he went on to say we \"brought bad energy to his house\" in terrible English & demanding Japanese. After apologizing for the miscommunication, the following day he demanded we let him in to our PRIVATE room while we were NOT there so he can pull out beds for guests. We were then kicked out because of his ridiculous accusations of us being \"terrible guests\" by not letting him go into our room when we weren't there to supply", " beds for people he overbooked for. We woke up to leave the next morning & found 2 guests sleeping on the floor with a yoga mate & some pillows in the entrance of the hostile. If we were there we surely would have let him into our room to grab beds, but we had our valuables in that room. The owner was unable to grasp the fact that the hostile is a business, not just a way to meet new people.

The entire establishment has been designed to deceive consumers into utilizing their inferior products and services.", "We chose this hotel because the reviews on booking.com are decent. But now we know why they are decent, because booking wouldn't publish our negative review.  On check-in we were charged more than we'd agreed to when booking, which we only realised after paying. On top of the mistake the staff were shocklingly rude for Japan, where the service is usually excellent. They did not apologise or even listen to our complaint properly. I guess we should have complained more and demanded our cash back the next day, but we were jet-lagged and had to leave early the next morning.  As another review mentioned, they do not take care of guests' personal information and just leave photocopies of passports lying behind the desk, which is worrying. But I guess because we can pass for Japanese,", " we were not asked for ID.

Eventually I left, but he would not return the money I had paid for the first night. By the time I actually got to a friend's house (past midnight), I was crying.  Talked to the manager later and he said the photocopying was \u201cnot mandatory\u201d. He said they had to check my residence card in case I was overstaying my visa - this is not the job of a hotel. He said he would ask his boss about a refund but at no point apologised. He got angry and criticised me repeatedly for getting upset and for showing the staff my ID in the wrong way(??).

seeing pretty favourable reviews on other sites. Overall, the stay was fine. We were told that there\u2019s a lift but was not told was that the lift does not serve both the 7th and 8th level. It was horrendous for us to lug up our heavy luggages up the stairs. As for washing, we were told that there was a washing machine but was not told that it was common for all to use. Also, we had to pay for each wash. That was fine until we saw that the dryer was broken and deep in winter, it would have taken ages for our clothes to dry. We literally gave up on washing our clothes. The cost of staying here was higher than others around Kuramae area which incidentally, provide better lodging and service. ", "The pictures do not reflect the reality of the room. Tiny and dirty. From dirty sheets to roaches running inside the room. The \u201cbalcony\u201d was dirty and stuffed with broken furniture. The bathroom is too small to fit someone taller than 1.65 meters.The towels are stiff and old of usage. The guy was unhelpful and barely in the building to attend guests. After finding the roach at night, the hotel reaction was lazy and unhelpful. We had to pay another hotel because there was no one to help us change the room. Next morning, after cancelling our plans for the day to fit the hotel schedule, we had to insist to get a refund on the nights we wouldn\u2019t spend there.

My family stayed there for 6 days 5 nights. Check-in time is at 4 pm local time & check out time is at 10 am. No luggages can park at the hotel at all. Through out my stay, I only saw 2 staff, interchanging from their shift work, working individually at the counter. The counter opens from 10 am- 10pm. Other than the timing outside with staff manning the counter, you can use the desk phone by the table to call them. The number is always written on the counter.  There are total only 4th floor, residential type of apartment. No lift, with 2 units facing each other from 2nd floor onwards. The only unit on the 1st", " floor is just by the side of the dirty bedsheets, towels & other soiled laundry. Only 1 Keys\u2019s assigned to each room. I books a junior family suit, which came with 3 queen size bed for 3 teenagers, my spouse & myself. There is a stand alone toilet, with hot bath tub, toilet & a washing area. Beside 1 of the room is a kitchen with stove, washing sink & a fridge. There are 2 Aircon units in the room & a small wardrobe to place your luggage & clothings.  There are only glass cups, washing detergent at the kitchen sink. Hangers inside the wardrobe. Toilet paper in the toilet. They provide bathing & hand towel, with tooth brushes & tooth paste. It\u2019s a DIY job if you need more toilet rolls, or towels. Don\u2019t expect the staff will change or bring in for you daily.  The unit was groomed when we 1st stepped into it. But........... The bedsheets weren\u2019t changed to the new ones as we can still see stains, hairs &  crumped signs. The toilet was \u201cdirty\u201d as we can see hairs; kinds of hairs if you know what I\u2019m referring too. Hahaha. All I did was just went direct down, beside the exit door, there is a rack with clean bedsheet & quilt covers, cleaning mop & sheets. I took 3 bedsheets, 3 quilts cover, a cleaning mop & a pack of mopping sheet. The changing & cleaning took us about 45 mins to considered clean & stayable to my family.  The pillows are pathetic thin, please bring your own pillow for a better support. I felt I was sleeping on the mattress when I slept on it.  Now, the only 2 advantages of this apartment is the location, it is only about 400m walk or 10 mins at most from Asakusa station. Please use A2b exit, Asakusa line to exit, which it has a lift & leading straight to it. Another which of course, the fee, I paid about S$1100 for a 5 night stays; Singapore dollars for the 5 of us, consider us as adult. The room comes with a pocket size WIFI router. But you must remember to charge it & to turn it on. With a limitation of 500MB daily of usage.  You can consider this \u201chotel\u201d if you find location & cost are important factors to your budget. I didn\u2019t know what I was booking as I need a room to accommodate my family & new a metro station. Thus, I just accepted these flaws.  Hope you find this review helps.

We asked if the room is ready and the guy said check in will be after 4pm. I said it can't be since my kids need to take their nap. The room was so small that we were cramped in that little space.

It seems like an office tower (Level 8) converted into a floor of Moderate priced/spartan rooms (7 or 8 rooms) that don't have a door/just a curtain...BUT you have an actual room (10 sq meters or so?) . Bathroom and showers are seperate but they do provide Locking cable for your luggage and the area is quiet and well air conditioned/ventilated. Possible negative is the receptionist is a little crusty but speaks adequate English. Lots of rules but it's easy to use. Checkin between Noon-3pm so have to make arrangements if early/later. Basic bed, but comfortable. Added plus is the Myfi hotspot that comes with the room and wifi standard.

We asked the hotel for a refund and when they did not respond, we asked AARP Travel for help. The hotel on several occasions told AARP that they don't speak English and to contact their manager.  This dragged on for months, and they later said it's too late for a refund.  They won't even give us credit for a room in the future when it is safe to travel.  While other businesses are sympathetic to the customers' dilemma, this one is a COLDBLOODED, UNSCRUPULOUS organization. Over 147 million people have died, and this hotel couldn't care less.

With the spreading of the coronavirus, the fact most of Government \u00a0told their citizen to observe strict confinement, the Olympic games in Japan being postpone (etc), I joined the hostel so they could make a gesture.  They did not. Not only they refused to cancel it, but they refused to postpone it, and moreover at no point they offered any beginning of a solution.   I sent messages to explain the cas de force majeure that is the coronavirus, and the answered I got were between 3 to 6 words.   AFTER I told them \"You are answering my long messages with very short sentences, of 3 to 6 words, in a contemptuous way\"... They answered with a copy-paste of 6 words they already wrote to me the same day \"Sorry", " free cancellation is not possible\"  They are the worst at handling things with customers. They are scornful, despising, and they deeply lack consideration for clients.  For people interested, here is the content of my conversation with this horrible guesthouse :   ME  Good evening. I'm following closely the coronavirus situation. On Wednesday was the largest daily increase of 41 infection cases in Tokyo. Yuriko Koike, the Governor of Tokyo is asking Tokyoites to stay home this weekend... I'd like to delay my stay in your guesthouse, since I think comong to Tokyo from the 3d to the 13th would be a reckless decision, due to the expansion of the virus. I don't want to put, neither other people, neither myself, at risk.  What do you propose ?  GUESTHOUSE Sorry free cancellation is not possible  ME  I understand, and I'm not asking for cancellation. Due to the very special circumstances can you do a gesture ? Everyone has to stay at home in several countries such as France. This virus is not to be taken lightly. I'd like not to cancel but to delay my stay. To come in June instead of now when it's risky. This is a case of force majeure.  Looking forward to your answer. Ferdinand Husson  GUESTHOUSE No refund We do the same with the Japanese government  ME I am not asking for a refund. I am asking for a modification of my dates.  GUESTHOUSE Cannot be changed  ME \u00a0 \u00a0I'm very sad to see your inability to do any offer, when the virus is litteraly creating a situation of crisis all around the world. The Olympic games have been canceled. Many Governement told their citizen to observe strict confinement. \u00a0 \u00a0This is obviously a very special situation. The website booking.com has a message on its frontpage to tell customers to contact their hostel to find a way to change their reservation in a reasonable manner. \u00a0 \u00a0You are answering my long messages with very short sentences, of 3 to 6 words, in a contemptuous way. \u00a0 \u00a0What do you think other customers will think of our discussion when I tell the story of how you poorly managed our interactions ? You'd rather stick to the money you can easily get, instead of helping a customer.   GUESTHOUSE Sorry free cancellation is not possible  No refund We do the same with the Japanese government  ME After my messages, you answer with a copy-paste ?  You're way of handling things is scornful and despising  It shows how deep is your lack of consideration for your customers", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": [], "price": null, "best_price_source": null, "restraunts_nearby": "669", "attractions_nearby": "32", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "95", "top_cuisines": ["Korean", "Vietnamese", "Barbecue", "Japanese"]},

First of all, whenever we message them via the booking platform there is no reply but we dismissed it thinking its a language barrier. Anyways, we message a week before out trip asking permission to drop off luggage upon arriving in the morning (check time time is 5pm) but receive no reply at all. On the day of arrival, we reckon we could ask directly at the reception so decided to go direct to the hostel around 10am. To our horror, the hostel is closed with its shutter down (giving the illusion that the hostel is closed down, refer photo!) and the contact number is unreachable. We contacted the booking flatform (AGODA) and even they are unable to reach the hostel and any of its staffs/contact numbers. This will happen the whole", " day, up until 5pm nobody was able to reach the hostel and its so ridiculous that even AGODA was unable to make any excuses for this hostel and decided to refund us instead quoting this property most likely a scam (please note by this time we are have been in Tokyo for 8 hours without any hostel and option for accommodation due to peak weekend).   The hotel only revert back to our desperate messages at 11pm with its staff lying to us saying that they are open at 10pm (?) does that even make sense. Which hostel in the world only open at 10pm when officially you are listed check in time at 5pm. Upon realizing that the booking is cancelled (by AGODA) they refused to book us again via walk-in method (we offered to pay cash) insisting that we must online book again eventhough we explain that no portal accept last minute booking and the property is listed at (sold out) since it so last minute.

I transferred in from Narita in just over an hour with the Keisei Skyliner and metro. The area in itself is pretty quiet, but serves as really convenient starting-point for exploring the rest of the city. A 24h FamilyMart and a supermarket right nearby. Beds (pods) come with a curtain for privacy and are quite spacious and comfortable. Outlets for charging of electronics and a (small) lockable locker. I stayed in the female dorm. Showers, sinks and toilets are right outside a thin sliding door, so make sure not to be placed in the pods closest to the door. Unfortunately it's one of the noisiest dorm I've ever stayed in, due to people hanging out in the", " reception area right below all night and people running in and out at all hours and leaving the door to the dorm (which was supposed to be locked after 11pm) unlocked and even completely open. The noise level made it hard to sleep through the night for any of my three nights there, even with earplugs. Though this is not really the hostel's fault (reception is not manned in the evenings), it was a drawback. At least make sure to bring some sturdy earplugs! :) Otherwise it was a good stay. I would consider staying again mostly due to the convenient location and good value for Tokyo. Just hoping for a crowd a bit more considerate in the dorm.

I'll start by saying that the location is VERY GOOD, 1 minute walk away from Sugamo station, a 24/7 supermarket, 24/7 restaurants, arcades, pachinko parlors, all within 1 minute walking distance away from the hostel, would have strongly recommended the place if not for everything else that plagued my experience of the place.   First, while the location of the hostel is very good, it does come with it's own problem, with it's proximity of the train station, you'll be hearing the train announcement from your hotel room, the train itself is not noticeably loud, at least not comparing to the bar which is located right above the hostel. I would not recommend staying there during the weekend if you're easily bother by noise,", " you'll be hearing everything that's going on in the bar.   One major problem I notice it the lack of personnel in the hostel, there's a maintenance guy that pass by every morning to clean up the beds of guests who checked out and that's it, no receptionist nor customer service, which brings another problem, check in, check in is self service, as in you receive an email with your bed number a code for a tiny locker. Inside which has a towel, toothbrush and the card key for your dorm. I and a few people I met during my stay encountered the same problem, we did not receive the email with all the important codes, yet none of the phone numbers listed in the hostel works, only the number listed on expedia worked.   Out of the 10+ days I stayed, my bed has not been cleaned once, and I did not received any new towel other than the first one in my locker, all that and the major bomb that happened during my last day. I saw this bed bug under my freaking pillow (I'm not an expert in bug so see the picture and judge for yourself), obviously after 2 attempts of contacting the staff via email, I received no reply, also did not manage to find any staff members during my last 2 days in the hostel. Let's hope it's just my bad luck and it was the only bed bug around.   Other than all these problems, the bed was comfortable, the AC in the bedroom was adequate. Bathroom is fine, with only one shower for the whole hostel though, but I usually didn't have to wait very long for my turn. The lounge is falling apart though, with part of it being boarded up. They had a fridge, a microwave and a water boiler, which is pretty useful, also has a paid washing machine and dryer, which was the god sent with my encounter with the bed bug.

Because Kyoka, who was very helpful to me, is such a nice person, I would like to be able to give a higher rating to Kyoka House. However, the integrity with which I offer my reviews prevents me from doing that just to be nice. I have rated this accommodation as average because the location of the place offers no benefits at all to make it attractive, yet the owner is very kind and available to help in any way she can. There is nothing in Nerima at all, and you are not conveniently close to any of the three closest stations. However, it's not crazy far, either, about a 12 minute walk to Heiwadai Station on the F Line subway-  which I was puzzled to discover that hardly anyone I asked about it had any idea it even", " exists, even though it was quite used by other passengers every time I got on, and of course there are F line signs at many other stations. Somehow it's a mystery line that's right in front of them and they don't know it, I guess.  I stayed in a Japanese room, not a Western room, and it was just fine. Wifi works fine. The bathroom & shower are separate and both outside of the rooms, but there was never any issue. The only thing I will say, and I beg this, is that I wish so much that all humanity would elevate their consciousness enough to realize the invaluable worth of learning how to silently shut a door like a ninja.   Bottom Line:   there is no decisive reason to stay or not to stay here. The location is a nothing, but the owner is quite kind and the rates are more reasonable than many others which have better locations.

There is no elevator, and luggage has to be pulled up a narrow winding staircase. The room included a very high loft, which was to be the 3rd bed, and reachable by climbing a near-vertical ladder. There were no beds (we knew this) and we pulled the overhead mattress down to make a sprawl on the floor.  There was a gas oven in the room, and we considered that too unsafe to ignite in a 100 sft room. The refrigerator refused to turn on, and we got no response on our email query. Being a completely selfservice apartment, we never saw anyone we could ask.  The room was", " cleaned daily, though, and included a kettle and sufficient crockery.  The neighborhood is a quiet residential one and there is a nice shrine nearby. Convenience stores and restaurants are all a block away, and the metro station and the bus stops are walking distance.

That's all I can say. The capsule room is alright for an overnight sleep. Ventilation might be a problem during the summer. As I went during the winter period, so it felt alright. On one of the night during my stay, the building was undergoing an overnight sewer/water supply work. The management did not give alternatives nor advice on the nearest toilet is... They simply stick a note advising the toilet re-open timing and promptly locked it. I had to run around the street in the middle of the night to find a toilet at a nearby combini.", "this is the worst hotel i've been in in my life . first it looks like a cell in a prison it's so dirty and dusty , they don't clean the common facilities , the toilet is so dirty it's smells like urine. the stuff is so unfriendly it was the worst check in of my life and the door locks of my capsle wasn't working i had to deal with it each time i got out , plus they don't clean the capsule... just run don't even think about spending one hour there . plus don't trust the pictures they posted on various website they are A LIE .", "For what you pay (25$US) it is a very good place to stay for those who do not want to spend a lot,better than a hostel since you have some privacy and do not risk getting stuck in an upper level bunk bed. The guesthouse is located in the Shinjuku district ( near a subway station)-an excellent location- a very large and vibrant commercial area with lots of shops, restaurants, and bars.  Quiet hours after 10PM were enforced while I was there.The 2 women who work at the front desk were great- they provided excellent customer service- they were nice and answered any questions I had. The wi-fi was very fast and reliable, it was clean (including the bathroom) and the bed/mat was very comfortable and I slept very well.   There was free instant coffee, tea and hot water when I was there", " and a grocery store across the street.  The negatives for the guesthouse are the rooms are small, the walls are are very thin (I could hear someone eating right next to me), 1 bathroom on the floor (men and women share the same bathroom) and sometimes at night there can be loud noise from the street.  A relatively easy way to find the guesthouse is to remember it is located across the street from a restaurant that has a sign that says \"Live King Crab\"-  and right by a bakery called CafeNord. (I have included pictures of both along with photos of the guesthouse)", "\u2026", "I really wanted to stay in a capsule hotel in Tokyo and I am so glad I chose oha guesthouse. My main concern with travelling alone is the safety of my belongings, but each capsule room has a lock and each room comes with an external locker.   You have to be silent after 10pm which was adhered to by everyone. If you cannot sleep, the WiFi connection is fantastic and fast enough to stream programming. Each room also comes with a tv, a light and a plug.   The staff here spoke perfect English and were really helpful.   The hotel has 2 bathrooms and 2 shower rooms. My only issue was that the 2 bathrooms have 1 toilet and 1 urinal in each but the urinal doesn\u2019t lock, so as a female I sometimes walked in on a male using the urinal, which I didn\u2019t enjoy. But the other toilet is upstairs", " and hardly ever in use, so I ran up there.

Tea and a kettle are provided anf two bottles of water in the fridge.  The staff is very friendly, but not very fluent in Engslish.   The hotel is located next to a JS line train station and 15 minutes walk from the nishi nippori metro station. The area is very quit and there are a lot of shops and bars is the neignbourhood. There is a big supermarket at 10 minutes walk. It was the best value for money room for  one person room I could find at that time. For the same price I could get a cabin in a hostel in the center. I am happy with my choice.", "I chose this hotel as it was almost half the price of other Tokyo hotels of the same standard and I am reasonably happy with the standard of the room. I loved the screened off area in my room where you can leave shoes as per Japanese custom.  There are many convenience stores including 7Eleven and restaurants across the road as well as around the hotel as well as the Mikawashima Railway station which connects you via 1 stop ( Nippori ) to Narita Airport terminals 1 and 2. Just catch the JR ( Japan Railways )  Joban Line to Nippori and then get the Keisei Skyliner to Narita Aiport v.v.  The hotel staff use Google Translate to talk and offer the bare minimum service which is not mentioned on the agent's site.   However, issues that the hotel needs to address in order to remain", " competitive are as follows ;  Tesheras checked me in ,late in the evening of 17th March 2018 and summarised on his screen that my stay is for 4 nights I fell asleep around 2300pm. I was awoken at 0930am the next morning by 4 loud knocks on the door.  Tesharas had his mobile with him and via Google Translate was telling me that I needed to have my room cleaned as checkout is at 10am ? I reminded him   I requested a quiet room at the time of reservation and again at check in - for the first night I arrived late so didn't notice the noise, the second night I slept all day as I was exhausted from a previous trip and was annoyed by the noise and the loud air conditioning ( later found a switch to switch it off ! )  On the morning of day 3 I had found the noise of the street unbearable  ; people's conversations in the street,cars,trains at the train station across the road could all be heard clearly due to the very thin and non enforced windows.  The room was changed to a Western room whose toilet had a urine stain in the middle front area.  Unbelievably,there is no safe,wardrobe or Iron - definately not somewhere you can leave valuables or check out from and head straight to an event/the airport with ironed clothing etc. I left my valuables in my locked suitcase.  Great if you want a Ryokan style room with private bathroom ( which Ryokans don't offer ) but again,the bare minimum service is offered.

Noisy even at midnight due to drinking places and the station. Room doesn\u2019t have toilet. Some light didn\u2019t turn on.  FYI - No TV, which is ok with me though.

The showers were well sized and had little bathtubs also, and there were 5 sinks in a shared powder room. I didn't have to wait to use any of these facilities. The gent on the front desk was super lovely and played some good tunes (Queen!). There is a fridge available and a very small common space, maybe fitting 5 people.

Since booking.com won't allow me review, I'll just leave it here:  Tokyo Art House is suberbly staffed! The host, Satoru-san who is also the house owner, is extremly nice, forthcoming, and attentive. He speaks fluent English. The hostel itself is a small but cute place. All in all, how much you'll enjoy your stay depends on what you are expecting. Sadly, the guest house cannot provide a big living or common room. The one which exists hosts a refrigerator, a microwave, multiple sinks, and space for a maximum of three to four people to sit. The mixed dorms downstairs also do not come equipped with the kitchen. The one which can be seen on the booking page is only available to guests of the", " upstairs dorm, as it says in the description.  The beds in the dorm room are comfy and come equipped with a curtain. Out the back  and on the rooftop, there are more common spaces, which will be especially nice come summer. Washing machines placed in the area out back are for free. Only women are allowed to also use a wascher-dryer combi located on the forth floor for a few hundred yen (this policy might have been revised). Who wants to wash without spending any money can dry their laundry on the rooftop.  As the Art House just recently openend, the facilities are really new and up to date. I can only speak for the period of time I've stayed, but the hostel was very clean as well.   The hostel it is located quite far from the city centre. However, access is still really easy. After taking the local line for one station, Nishi-Nippori station allows access to the Yamanote Line, which heads straight for famous spots such as Shinjuku (40 min), Shibuya, Tokyo station and Akihabara. The hostel is also in close quaters to Ueno, with it's beautiful park and renowned museums.

In general they were very kind to store our luggage from 10:30 until check in at 14:00 which is usually first granted from 15:00. A few people were hanging out in the lobby which is also the breakfast room and reception and kitchen. Everything looked very nice and well designed. The rooms (walled with pressed wood plates) are small but clean - windows can be opened. As in every hostel you have a couple of regulations: Slippers, mask, handwash, gurgle, etc..

I feel like the other reviews that give it an average-low score aren't considering that it's a pretty cheap hostel (the walls are thin, there are lockers but they're only big enough for your electronic devices/wallet/passports). Given the price, I really enjoyed Focus Kuramae. The beds were quite comfortable, the bathrooms spotless, and every evening you could come downstairs and hang out with other travelers in the cafe. The staff were also quite helpful--my friend and I both caught a pretty bad virus and the hostel staff were nice enough to find a local walk-in clinic that took English-speaking patients and book us appointments.

Especially our bedroom was by the exit door that everyone seems to slam. They rent towels. They have a 2 in 1 washer and dryer. There is a \"kitchen\" that everyone can use which is also in the same room as the restaurant. You also have to go through the restaurant if you want to enter or exit the hostel which can get pretty awkward. The room we had was pretty small. It fits a double bed with barely any room for suitcases. The room included a double bed, nightstand, chair and a trashcan. We ended up putting our stuff on top of the chair and the nightstand because there was no room for any storage.", "I stayed at Focus Kuramae in one of the private rooms for 5 nights and had a fabulous stay. Staff were very friendly and happy to help with any questions. Although the room was small it was perfectly sized for two people who wanted to crash out in a comfy bed at the end of the day BUT having two large suitcases was a little difficult as we couldn't open the door the whole way, keep this in mind when you pack! The shared bathrooms were incredibly clean and toothpaste/brushes, hairdryers and shower products were provided. Also available was towels for 300 yen from reception downstairs.

WiFi is fast, and all information regarding accommodation guidelines and the like are well posted. Although quite a distance away from the main attractions of Tokyo, I would recommend staying here simply for the convenience afforded by the amenities. This is not to be confused with the hostel type accommodation on the second level.", "One of the things that attract me to the place is its price.  For Tokyo standard, the rate is very cheap.  Since I planned to stay for three more nights after my official travel, an affordable place can really help stretch my budget.  I could not believe that I can still find a place like T House in Tokyo.  Apart from being very affordable, the place is just few meters away from Heiwajiima Station.  Since it's a residential area, I like the quietness of the locality.  There is a nearby convenience store if you want a quick snack or just about anything you need as a traveler.  Restaurants and grocery stores are also available in the neighborhood.  The house is clean, well-maintained, and quiet.  Fits very well with my temperament.  I stayed in single room with shared bathroom. ", " The room, as expected, is very small especially that I had a huge luggage, but it's functional.  The bed was comfortable and just right for a good night rest.  The bathroom was one floor down so it was a bit of a hassle.  Fortunately, we have different shower schedules so I didn't get to wait.  There's a water heater that I brought inside the room for my constant caffeine fix.  There was also a free washing machine that I was eager to use but could not because the instruction has no English translation.  For three nights, my room has not been cleaned.  I am not sure if it's really the set up.  A mop was also available outside for quick cleaning maybe.  I was not bothered because I maintained the cleanliness of the room so it was not really dirty or messy.  One advantage of a small room is that there's not enough room to be messy.    Since there was no elevator, it was really a challenge bringing up my huge luggage.  The stairs was narrow so you have to be careful especially if you're carrying heavy luggage.  Because of the small space, you could almost hear the conversation of the occupants from the next room. It would be nice if they can make the walls a little thicker for an added privacy.  I am not sure if there's an available microwave oven, but it would have been nice to have one in the common area.    To make your stay more convenient, I suggest that you bring your bathrobe especially if you will take the shared bathroom room.  It's awkward to be walking in the hall with just the body towels on.  Speaking of towels, it would be nicer if they change their towels into something more thick.  Or if you are really picky, just bring your own towel.  Haneda airport is just 10-15 minutes away (or less) through train so I did not find a hard time on my last day.

The same owners have opened New Chiyoda, and now I'm not sure I can go back to the older one.  They truly spared no expense when planning this bright, clean, wooden-throughout modern guest inn.  The one feature that some may not appreciate, which keeps the price very reasonable, is that private toilets and showers are located in the hallway on both floors.  You have a sink with hot/cold water in the sleeping room.  Everything is kept ultra-clean in the common areas, and you can request room cleaning each day (it is up to you to request.) There is a well-outfitted kitchen and dining area, and also a coin-operated laundry room on the first floor.  There are little", " touches where you can tell the owners care about the comfort of the guests; one such feature is a space heater in the downstairs toilet - it was running all the time, and these conveniences are not cheap to run in Japan - I appreciated the warmth!  There are several twin-bed rooms and mostly singles.

There was proper air con system and not a fan as so many hostel advertise air con and it isn't I found.   There was a little seating area where you could eat, but not an entire kitchen set up but who cares! The sleeping area was lovely, you get like a little private unit which was great to have some privacy again. The hostel", " also had security it had a proper locking system on the door.

No question about it. Very clean, near train stations, near convenience stores, quiet area, very good wifi, with bathtub and heater and complete utensils, even trash bag were provided. Buttt.. Since it was winter (more luggage for thick coats), and i went with my parents who are seniors already, we were always tired at the end of the day. Felt like we were always on the rush. Always had to look for alternative ways to get to the city with the shortest time possible or lesser number of transfers. Check-in process was also a hassle for me, since i had to input all info about each guest.", "This place is quite far from downtown.  It is about 30 min from Shibuya station.  Eventough it is quite far, the place has bigger accommodation area than normal Tokyo\u2019s apartment or hotel.  It has complete kitchen, washing machine and oven for basic living while staying there.  The location is also 10 min walk from 2 station so it is very easy to be accessed.  Close to accommodation there are many supermarket that can provide basic needs like breakfast or dinner.  There are also some Japanese and even burger restaurant around.  So it is very convenient indeed.  With pricing given, it is totally worthy.  Room is very clean, towels and bed linen are clean as well.  Totally recommended for simple couples or small family.

The way the bed is situated, you'd have to jump over each other to get off the bed in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. Not really a hassle for us, but might be a hassle for those of you", " who are light-sleepers. We luckily got a corner room, and bright windows on 2 sides, and had a view of the city!  There are plenty of USB plugs right by the bed, and also a couple of electric plugs for your chargers.   There's a vending machine on our floor, just in case you really wanted something to drink. We usually opted to walk to the convenience store, though, because it's way cheaper than the vending machine.  You'll see from our pictures how we situated our backpack and carry on luggage (we only brought 1 travel pack and 1 carry on suit case for our 2 week trip). We had to place the backpack on the table, and the suit case at the corner of the room. Even with 2 small suit cases, it was a very tight fit, but it was totally manageable for us.

The hostel is distinctly average and there are bed bugs in dorm C at least. As a group of 4, we weren't happy at all because we didn't meet any staff during our entire stay. Would not recommend staying. ", "The Star Inn is a fantastic place to stay in Tokyo! It was like experiencing a real Japanese home just outside of the city and in a lovely local area. We were a bit apprehensive before staying at the Star Inn as it seemed very far out of Tokyo and the photos did not do it any justice. However, we absolutely loved our stay and wish we stayed for longer than 2 nights! (We were in the private double and the bed was so comfortable). Theres a very close train station in Aoto where you can get to pretty anywhere in Tokyo, it was great and very easy to get to from the Airport. We will be recommending this place to other travellers and friends :) thank you again for a wonderful stay. Amy & Max from England ", "Been here with my friends. And we're really love it.  The front desk is only until 10pm, and we're come after it. But we already inform to them about our arrival time, so the staff keep waiting until we check in. Kind of worried regardings to the reviews here, but after we check in we're decide that we're love this place. The family room is small for 5 and our luggage, so we decided to take out 1 bed from the room and we're share the other bed. The staff is so kind and friendly and so informative. I will recommend this place to my friends.", "I found this place to be convenient as a base for exploring Tokyo. Seems to be owned and run by a small collective of friends so it\u2019s cool to support an independent hostel rather than a mega-hostel. The neighbourhood is very chilled and, though there\u2019s not much to do directly around, it\u2019s kinda\u2019 cool to get an insight into suburban capital life. The hostel is easy to get to from Narita airport as it\u2019s a straight ride on the Keisei line. It\u2019s quite a commute to western Tokyo from here but - logically - convenient for Eastern Tokyo sights like Ueno Park or Oshiage Skytree. In conclusion, don\u2019t hesitate to chose this place; it\u2019s a more than solid choice.", "My families and I stayed in Star Inn for 3 nights. The rate per night is relatively cheap compared to other hostel.   Small and cosy, clean and very friendly staff who could speak good English.  However I think the location of the hostel is a little far from the sub way station, about 10 mins walk.  There are many cosy restaurants around the hostel and the 7-11 is just 5 mins away from it.  For those who love to bowl, there is a bowling alley nearby just newly renovated.

But a couple things need to be addressed, 1. On my first morning, a housekeeper tried to open my door without knocking, what if I was changing and other guest was walking pass the hallway? This is totally unprofessional for them to do this, knock before you enter a room is a common sense, shouldn\u2019t be making this kind of mistake at all.  2.

The location was amazing and just down the street there were a bunch of cool bars and affordable restaurants. I had some of the best ramen of my life just around the corner. The staff was super friendly and gave us some good recommendations for things to do in Tokyo too. The bed was really comfortable as well. Definitely recommended!", "Our expectation of G-Stays when researching for our trip was relatively low, but we were encouraged by many reviews raving about location and quality of the rooms. Our experience (which is ongoing at time of writing), has been anything but.  Location is certainly central - but what people fail to mention is this establishment is nestled amongst the sleazy 'love hotels' and nearby strip clubs. This may not be a issue for many, but families may want to think twice.  Space wherever you are in Japan is a premium, and we did not expect to have the largest room when booking with G Stays. However, my partner who is 5\"7 only just manages to fit under an incredibly inconvenient archway between the kitchenette and the bedroom. As a 6\"3 male, the number of times I have hit my head on this", " is unreal. Let alone the height of the bathroom ceiling once in the shower, meaning I can not stand while showing. The toilet in the same bathroom is also squished between the wall the door and the sink - all fitting into no more than 3 square metres.  When checking in, we were told as we were staying for a duration of 5 nights we would receive a \"courtesy clean\" of the room (weird, as an establishment that is consistently described as a 'hotel', I would've expected this daily?). We arranged for the clean to occur on the 3rd day of our stay, and upon returning found the room untouched. When asking the front desk if this was our mistake, they told us the clean was scheduled for the following day. Innocent mistake perhaps, but this voids the whole point of a clean halfway through your stay.  Throughout our stay (and again, continuing at time of writing) the most notable problem with this \"hotel\" is the maintenance and renovations in progress. At 8:30am every morning, we have been awoken by loud banging from inside the building. Maintenance is understandable and is clearly needed within the establishment. However we were not notified at check-in and there were no signs indicating this anywhere throughout the building. A clear annoyance for anyone wanting to sleep past 8:30am.  In summary; would not recommend. ", "\u2026", "Next door to the Subway Station, which in Tokyo means everything. The Staff is efficient and ready for prompt help, in whatever you need. Several convenience stores and 24h supermarket nearby. Also there are lots of restaurants, pharmacies and beauty stores in walking distance.

The shrine is a 15 min max walk away from the hostel and if you feel incline to continue which I heavily recommend, then another 30 minute walk to the Tokyo sky tree. The dormitory comes with a shower in the room and toilets are outside. The floor and bathrooms were always tidy and as odd as it to say to this, the toilets were a work of art. Especially how it\u2019s flushed. I do recommend trying the Japanese curry and Plum wine from the restaurant. My brothers felt extremely comfortable there and made some friends with some other travelers staying in the hostel. We had no problem finding the place because location was saved into google map. It\u2019s a walk away from the Ginza, Asakusa and the Hibaya line. I think the Asakusa line was the closest. I think this was by far the most welcoming place that I\u2019ve stayed in all of my travels.

The bed was not the most comfortable as the mattress for our tatami was so thin it was nearly nonexistent. Hard to sleep on the side as your hipbones hurt too much.

{"hotel_name": "Smi:re Stay Oshiage", "rating": "4.5", "review_count": "6 reviews", "hotel_rank": "#13 of 100 Speciality lodging in Sumida", "amenities": ["Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)", "Wifi", "Non-smoking hotel", "Self-serve laundry", "Air conditioning", "Kitchenette", "Microwave", "Refrigerator", "Non-smoking rooms"], "languages": null, "reviews": ["Share", " ", "We're a family of 4 and stayed at the quadruple room for 4 nights. We chose Smi:re Stay Oshiage mainly for how it looks and where it's located.   Pros: Great location, modern design, comfy beds, kitchenette, and in-room washing machine  Cons: No daily housekeeping, no wardrobes, tight hallway, could have used a full-sized mirror  Bottomline: Despite minor drawbacks, Smi:re Stay Oshiage is an excellent choice for a small family like ours. We definitely recommend this for staying in Tokyo.  Here's a more detailed review of Smi:re Stay:  1. Design We loved the minimalist design with concrete, wood, and glass. It kinda felt like sleeping in a Muji store (in a good way)!    2. Size & Layout It's not in any way tiny, but since the layout of the room is narrow, it's also not the most", " spacious, especially since we had several luggage (however, there is enough space in corners and under the beds to stow them).   Two bedrooms are connected by a tight hallway, where the separate toilet and bathroom are located. The bigger room contains the master bed, dining area, and kitchenette, so it can be a bit cramped. The smaller bedroom, however, is just perfect for our 2 kids.   Technically, there's no work desk but the dining table can serve that purpose.  3. Comfort & Cleanliness The mattresses are very comfy, cozy, and soft, so we certainly slept well. The hotel also provided pajamas and disposable slippers so plus points for that.   The two rooms have air-conditioners to keep them cool (or warm, in our case, since we were here in December). The toilet (Japanese toilets with their built-in bidets are the best) and shower are very clean.   Water temperature is adjustable and water pressure is strong. Lots of towels and toiletries for everyone. Our only complaint is that there's only one mirror, which is placed too high for little kids. A full- or even half-sized mirror in the corridor perhaps would have been nice.  4. Service There is no lobby or front desk. The cafe/bar in the building serves that purpose. But Kenzo, who was on duty, was very friendly and helpful.   As for housekeeping, they throw the trash and replace the towels every other day and make the bed every 4 days. We're not too happy with that, but it's no deal breaker either.  5. Amenities As this is a serviced apartment, the room is equipped with a kitchenette with a stove, microwave oven, kettle, and fridge. There are plenty of glasses, mugs, plates, and utensils. Breakfast isn't included, so we just bought sandwiches from the nearby Family Mart or 7-Eleven.   There are plenty of hangers but no wardrobe cabinets, just a couple of wooden racks to hang our jackets. We liked that there's a washing machine in the room with free laundry soap for a single wash. The funny thing though is we had to dry up our clothes on a steel bar on top of the TV!     Speaking of the TV, only local channels are available. But the free and fast Wi-Fi made up for it.  6. Location & Security The location is excellent as Oshiage/Skytree is a great base to explore Tokyo. We can even see the famous Tokyo Skytree from our room! The hotel is a 5-min. walk from Skytree/Solamachi and a 1-min. walk from the B1 exit of the Oshiage/Skytree Station.   It's also in a quiet and safe side street of the neighborhood, so we we had a restful sleep during our stay.   7. Check-in & Check-out The check-in was super fast, with Kenzo double-checking our booking details and explaining the house rules for a few minutes. We were greeted by Pepper the robot at the elevator area (she's a delight, though she needs more information loaded in her system to be truly useful).  Check-out was just a matter of posting a check-out card at the reception.   8. Family Friendly The hotel is great for families. Our kids have a separate room (a bed each). Access to the station is a short walk for them. There's strong Wi-Fi if they just want to chill. And they loved interacting with Pepper the robot.", "\u2026", "We spent 8 nights in this neat and tidy hotel for our family trip this Summer!  The 4 ppls room was good enough for our family (2 adults + 2 teenagers)!  The location of the hotel is so convenient (juz a few minutes walk from the Skytree Station)!  Love it & highly recommended!", "Great hotel, very helpful staff. It is very close to Oshiage station which easily takes you to all the interesting Tokyo spots via metro and JR trains. It is also 10 minutes walk to Tokyo Solamachi for shopping. ", "The room was very spacious, staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel itself was located really convenient place which surrounded so many convenience store and good restaurant.

Rooms are not huge but super efficient and of you're coming to Tokyo and spending most of your time in your room... You're not doing travel the right way. Things to do and places to see are Skytree, Asakusa and Sumo district... There's a cool little Thai restaurant around the corner with a katsu place and a coffee shop right next to that. The hotel is quiet with the exception of the divider door between rooms... We had a fairly loud Indian lady Skype chatting in front of the", " frickin door at 2 am... Knock on the door...

Our 17 year of nephew would much rathered be in the action packed areas. But a 10-15 walk to train station, made getting to those areas no problems. Nice being near the river. We did a fantastic cooking class 10 min walk away wiht Tokyo Kitchen which was great. Room was ok, not to big but ok for Tokyo standards I think. Staff were helpful when we needed them. Room could have come with more information on aircon etc, and area, restaurants etc but we found enough.", "We stayed in a two bedroom apartment. It was comfortable for five of us .we arrived quite early and they allowed us to check in . Upon checking out we deposited our luggages with them for 1000yen which was reasonable for 5 luggages.   Location wise , it\u2019s about 15mins walk from Asakusa Station , roads mostly flat . If you don\u2019t mind the location this is a good choice .

Everything you expect from a hotel is there and much more \u2013 24 hour reception, ensuite bathroom and even common kitchen/dining room.   The hotel is nice a mix of traditional Japanese ryokan and modern hotel. We especially liked that you have to remove footwear and use provided slippers when you enter the lobby.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Though official check-in time is 3p.m. our room was ready as early as 12:30 p.m. \u2013 very welcoming after long flight and jetlag. Even if some of the hotel staff don\u2019t speak English well we encountered absolutely no language barrier. Japanese hospitality is what you really get here.  Our room for 3", " (western style) was a bit small but that\u2019s expected from Japanese hotels. Bathroom was also very small but it even contained a bathtub! Spotlessly clean. Wi-Fi connection was very fast and stable. Some may find beds and pillows hard but again, that\u2019s Japanese way.  Wagokoro is situated in a quiet neighborhood, there are all usual 24/7 conbini just around the corner and a lot of restaurants near train station. Nippori station is just 5 minutes walk (or 410Y taxi ride if it\u2019s raining or you need to haul heavy luggage). The station is directly connected to Narita airport \u2013 Skyliner is faster and sometimes cheaper than NEX train. Yanaka cemetery and Arakawa tram are in short walking distance.

First of all, when checking in, you will find that all the front desks are interns. When I ask them some questions, they always need to turn their heads and get into the small room behind to ask regular employees.  I think that as a mature Mitsui with dozens of chain hotels, the intern should not be left alone at the front desk.    Secondly, neither the interns at the front desk nor the regular employees hiding behind can communicate in basic English, which surprised me a lot.  Shouldn't this aspect be strengthened at the time when the Olympics are coming?

In this way of responding to customers, he lacks the basic qualities of front desk staff.  I have stayed in many Mitsui hotels before, but this experience makes me very hesitant to make reservations for Mitsui hotels in the future.  I will try to discuss this with their general manager tomorrow when I check out, but I don\u2019t expect they would realize their problems.  Don\u2019t be fooled by their design or look.

This is the second time that we've been to the Sotetsu Fresa Inn property.  Previously, it was under a different name/ownership.  Here's the $64K question:  Does Size Matter for your room?

If you have large luggage, there's a good chance you'll be \"hopping\" over it in the aisle.  When you sit on the toilet, your knees almost hit the door.

It's not the cleanest/safest area, but there are really good restaurants if you look hard enough.  There's an excellent Tonkatsu restaurant in the Aroma One contemporary building that's TDF.  We found an excellent \"carousel\" style sushi restaurant in the Kamata train station on the 6th floor that will be our go to sushi place in the years to come.  Top notch sushi at a very reasonable prize.  Great!  On the food and beverage side of this hotel, they definitely need improvement.  They have a buffet Japanese style breakfast for around $10-12.00.  The first morning we were there, the \"hot\" food did not have covers on any of the items.  The food was warm at best.  My suggestion is that if you are going to serve a Japanese buffet breakfast, put your best foot forward.    The next day, I made a mention of this fact to Ms. Kajiwara/Hotel Manger on Duty.  She was apologetic and said that she'll note this and pass on the information to her staff.  Surprisingly, the very next day I was shocked to see that 90% of the \"hot\" food items had plastic covers on them!  The breakfast experience was so much better......  The dilema to traveller's is this:  Do I want to sacrifice important space in my room for the convenience of being close to the Kamata rail station.

Be sure to have your own electrical adapter (if you need one).  They do have them available - but they are for purchase, rather than lending them to you for your stay.

This hotel follows the excellent standards of APA hotels such as efficient check-in, English speaking staff, impeccable cleanliness but that's where the positive comparison ends. We knew to expect a small room but the Tawaramachi hotel took cramped to a whole new level. Our previous hotel we could slide our luggage under the bed but here the bed base is down to the ground. It was a smaller room anyway which we didn't think possible but this room is really only fit for one person. There is, quite literally NO where to move with 2 people and their luggage. Nowhere at all.  Secondly, the breakfast. Our first APA hotel had a decent buffet breakfast and being the same chain expected similar. But no. Here,", " you drop into the adjacent fast food outlet where your breakfast voucher entitles you to a microscopic proportion of egg, a piece of toast, a small salad and a coffee/tea. That's it. If you're looking for a proper breakfast, look elsewhere.  Thirdly, the curtains. Our first APA had full blockout curtains and we expected similar but unfortunately the curtains here allow the morning light to filter through denying oneself the opportunity to sleep in and some needed winks.   Forthly, the TV. OK, so this is the same as the other hotel but who in their right mind mounts a TV of such massive proportions in such a tiny space. Seriously this TV is bigger than the average person would have in their lounge room but to have such a TV in a room like this is just bizarre.

It was right near the subway station or a 10-15 minute walk to Ueno station (major station with shinkansen and JR lines). The hotel was right near the precinct of Asakusa where we explored the various temples, bought souvenirs and street food.

While some of that was true, I was apprehensive about the APA hotel, though am pleased to report that - although the rooms are smaller than a Brit may be used to - they\u2019re still fine for tall people and you will fit in the bed (they do these funny flat pillows in Japan that weren\u2019t the easiest, but if you ask at the desk they will get you a bigger one that\u2019s more like the ones we have in the west).   The room was spotless, and while I did occasionally struggle to manoeuvre around the bathroom (which is quite small for a tall person), I was able to use the facilities fully and", " found the room very good value for money (my wife is normal sized and also liked it). There\u2019s a huge TV in it, there\u2019s WiFi, there\u2019s a fridge for you to make use of (which was a godsend, as we were able to stock up at the 7-Eleven or Family Mart and leave things there), there\u2019s even laundry and baths upstairs. They left us bottled water every day which really came in handy too (Japan is roasting in October which I was not expecting). The staff were great, it\u2019s right on the Ginza line, easily accessible from Narita airport, and though it\u2019s not what you\u2019d consider a luxury hotel, if you\u2019re in Tokyo on holiday you shouldn\u2019t be using the room for anything but sleeping and showering anyway. Also there\u2019s a great pastry shop to your left as you come out the front door, a little independent bakery, that\u2019s worth going to for sure.", "\u2026", "I stayed for 5 nights and the service was excellent.

So the guests could be handle more faster to get check in  But overall is good , thank you shinjuku Prince Hotel for your service and thank you for your kindness , we enjoyed our stay, and my fiance said she want us to stay at Shinjuku Prince Hotel again next time ,", "\u2026"], "hotel_class": ["City View", "Business"], "price": "11295", "best_price_source": "ZenHotels.com", "restraunts_nearby": "3076", "attractions_nearby": "194", "good_for_walkers_out_of_100": "100", "top_cuisines": ["Japanese", "Japanese", "Japanese", "Japanese"], "restaurants": [{"name": "Shinkei", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "4 reviews"}, {"name": "R Baker Inspired by Court Rosarian Seibu Shinjuku Pepe", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Gyukatsu Aona Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Presotea Seibu Shinjuku Pepe", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Segafredo Zanetti, Seibu Shinjuku Pepe", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sakura Sushi", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shogun Burger Shinjyuku", "cusines": ["", "Fast food", "Steakhouse", "American", "Cafe"], "reviews": "50 reviews"}, {"name": "Sanju", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Ikkemme Sakaba Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Miso No.1 Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Yakitorin Mottsuman Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Shabu Shabu Full Private Room Kururi Shinjuku East Entrance", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Namaste Dining & Bar", "cusines": ["", "Thai", "Asian", "Indonesian"], "reviews": "5 reviews"}, {"name": "Real Creative Cuisine Tsukiiro-No-Yoru", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Bannai Kabukicho", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Hidakaya Seibu Shinjukumae", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Cheese Cheese kitchen Shinjuku East Entrance", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Uotami Seibu Shinjuku Eki-Mae", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Sakuratei", "cusines": ["", "Japanese", "Grill", "Asian", "Healthy"], "reviews": "673 reviews"}, {"name": "Bagus Seibushinjuku", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Torikizoku Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Doma-doma Shinjukukabukicho", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Izakaya Nijyu -maru Seibushinjyuku ekimae", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Ramen Fusenka", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shinkei Ichigaya", "cusines": ["", "Japanese"], "reviews": "1 reviews"}, {"name": "Yakitoriya Torikizoku Seibu-Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Completely Private Izakaya Kururi Shinjuku", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shinjukukko Dining Pecori", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Shabu Shabu Kururi", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Onyasai Seibushinjukuekimae", "cusines": [], "reviews": null}, {"name": "Oyster Bar Wharf", "cusines": ["", "Seafood"], "reviews": "37 reviews"}, {"name": "Shichirin Yakiniku Anan Shinjuku", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "McDonald's Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [", ", " "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Ramen Hosenka", "cusines": [], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Pastaya Kagetora", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Ichiryu Seibu Shinjuku Ekimae", "cusines": [" "], "reviews": "\n"}, {"name": "Human Restaurant", "cusines": ["", "International", "Japanese", "Bar", "American", "Healthy"], "reviews": "5 reviews"}]},

I really enjoyed the stay. I thought it was an exciting and different experience for a really good price and in an excellent location. The bathroom facilities were great, as was the sauna. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the beds were not the comfiest and it was often difficult to sleep due to the volume of other guests on the corridor and that the corridor light was left on all night. Also, it was absolutely boiling!  Staff were very helpful. Although this was a fun experience, I would recommend it for the solo traveller or friends of the name gender, not couples. Exciting for a few nights but if you're a light sleeper it's maybe not the place for you.", "This capsule Hostel is a very nice and clean place with the great option to relax in the sauna, the beds are comfortable and bigger than I thought and the staff is very nice as well.The only critic I have is that the lights are always on in the room so even when you are in the capsule it is never completely dark also it is a waste of energy. ", "I booked from expedia and read the reviews before booking, and everything on the comments/review sections seems to be pretty accurate The capsules are more modern than other places, it\u2019s very clean and well organized. They gave me a bag filled with 2 towels, Pj\u2019s , toothbrush set, slippers and a tray inside the assigned locker. The locker assigned is pretty big, enough to fit one cabin sized luggage, a full sized backpack, wintercoat and more. It just wouldn\u2019t fir larger size luggages, but there are space available for that! The receptionist also offered to keep my huge luggage in the locker on the lobby floor (which I personally think is safer, there\u2019s tag number, my name signed on a form and someone will always be there to look after it imo?). The shower size is pretty tight,", " I didn\u2019t get to try the sauna though. The capsule size is okay, yes there will be noise every now and then, but it\u2019s manageable, it\u2019s just like having a roommate back in Toronto.   I felt secured and confident once I found out that everyone needs to give their keys to the receptionists everytime they leave the building, and exchange it with a token/card-like with their room number on it. I think it\u2019s brilliant for security purposes.   The pillow is a bit weird, like made out of beans or something. It\u2019s fine with me though cause I have my own travel neck pillow. There is a blanket as well. The \u201cdoor\u201d on the website looks like an actual door, but it\u2019s actually just a blind.  The only thing you should know is that food and drink is not allowed in the cabin (allowed in the lobby only), the shower room is in a different floor. There is elevator, but must be able to take one level stair up to the lobby.   Overall, I have a good experience. It\u2019s perfect if you are on a budget, just need somewhere to crash and don\u2019t mind tight spaces. Remember to bring earplugs if you\u2019re a light sleeper! :)", "\u2026", "1 min walk from the station, free wifi, clean bathroom and friendly staff. I wish there\u2019s a small foldable desk in the bedroom so that I can use my laptop. The sleep area is also quiet. Slippers, room wear, towels, shampoo are also provided. Can buy razor, water, skincare set at the check-in counter.", "Very helpful staff. Facilities are extremely well kept and clean. Great location, 2 minute walk to Ebisu station on the Yamanote line.
