Yotel Air Singapore Changi Airport,4.0,515 reviews,#111 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese","Share, ,Our room had a faulty air conditioner and we phoned the front desk and a friendly receptionist said that she will get another room ready for us. She even gave us late checkout to 2pm, free vouchers for jewel's shops and restaurants and tickets to the canopy bridge too! We were floored by her service!   Room's bathroom has excellent water pressure and soap smells so good!  We also loved how the tv has chrome cast so we can stream YouTube on it for some karaoke haha!  One downside was that the mattress was a little uncomfortable, it was a tad too soft for my liking.   Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay at yotel air! ,We stayed at Yotel after cycling via East Coast Park to Changi airport. Excellent and well priced accommodation located conveniently in Jewel at Changi airport. Although small, the room is very well designed and provided everything we needed for a short overnight stay,The coffee machine in the lounge provided an excellent cappuccino.,Well..theres not much to say. You paid for a room, and you get exactly that. The price was very affordable ($120/n) and the room was small yet cosy. The room was also very clean. The main selling point of this hotel is its location, located right within Jewel. Overall the stay exceeded my expectations.,Checking in is simple, i managed to get a room on the lobby floor so i really like that as there are rooms located on other levels (Lift required), so I have no qualms about it. It's cabin compact which is really comfortable for 1 pax. Bed is very large and cozy. TV is very wide too. Will recommend if you intend to explore Jewel on a short term trip. ,Amenities required for the entire is readily available. Service from the staff were great and they were quick to address issues that we highlighted and follow up to keep us updated. Room is definitely on the smaller side, might be hard to move around if you have big baggage or alot of stuff",,7156,Expedia,138,98,88
Hotel 1888 Collection,3.5,39 reviews,#119 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Hi, i had a 1 night stay from 23-24 November and i had an amazing stay there. We booked a family room that was able to accommodate up to 4 adults! We were greeted by the staff name Ben and i would like to thank him for compensating the late check in for us. Instead if 3pm, it had to be done at 4 pm due to some issue on the AC.  Ben was giving a very good service and would like to thank him for giving us such as amazing  experience for my friends and I  The room was amazing with the large bath tub and the projector, the bed was large and very clean. would definitely come back to this place again.  However, we were having some issues regarding the projector and the language was in Mandarin?  i think and we had a hard time trying to connect to the wifi, tho the wifi speed was not, that good.  Location wise was good, sitting in the heart of Chinatown.   I would like to leave a not for Ben for being so kind and accommodating to my friends and i!,…,stayed here for 1 night. woke up a few time as the aircon stopped by itself during the night. it was suppose to be a staycation to relax but in the end i felt so tired. on check out day, lights n aircon automatic off by itself a few times (almost once every hour) and i have to keep getting out of bed n switch it on. Gave my feedback to reception staff, they just apologise and that’s it. Do not feel any sincerity in his apology. Totally waste my $$... understand it’s 10m2 room but it’s too small even without luggage. but overall location is good. room is clean.,I thought i wont be staycationing anytime soon and able to squeese some time for one on a weekday Pretty basic amenities, minimalistic design, comfy bed and been a light sleeper sort of, been disturbed by next room talking or whatever happen.,Came back for another stay because I really enjoyed my previous one but it was a nightmare this time and will very well be my last. When I checked in in the afternoon, I informed the lady that if my friend were to come, I'd get him to check in as well since I was unsure at that point.  My friend only came at 11pm and a different staff at the front desk asked for my room number and said that because my friend was not registered, hence a visitor, should not be allowed in after 11pm. I might have missed out this rule, my bad. He graciously gave us 5 mins while we had a full takeaway meal in our hands. :-) He proceeded to ask for my friend's NRIC and asked to fill in the declaration form (the exact process as when I checked in earlier). So I casually asked, if he's not staying for, the night, he has to do this same process as well? The staff said yes, so we did accordingly. So I asked the staff again, since he already has his particulars taken and filled the form, can he stay later than the gracious 5mins he has given us? He said no. And I was just so bewildered. I asked him why he couldn't just check my friend into the system and he said because I didn't inform anyone (I did) and that I asked if my friend needs to have his particulars taken down if he's not staying - which he then accused me of ""keep changing my words"". He was so defensive throughout and not hearing me at all. I was not even trying to manipulate the system or rules.   I was genuinely curious and my point was, if he had already taken all the information he needed, couldn't he have just registered my friend into the system so my friend then has the option to choose if he wants to stay 5 mins, 3 hours or through the night? Rather than accusing me of ""changing my words"". He was not even listening to my theory and after a few exchanges with him raising his voice and being defensive, he reluctantly said he'll check my friend in then. This could have been solved way faster and easily in my opinion. I work in the hospitality sector and has had my fair share of work experience in hotels and this was just such a turn-off.   Everything else was great but too bad he made it such an unpleasant one.,…,Went there staycation alone in the hotel . Walked in the room just to find out the house keeping didn’t clean the area very well , Mr Yong sang kept on apologising on behalf , very attentive and honest reception I’ve met so far . The company should provide more training to the staff in order for them to be more aware of what’s happening . Thanks to Mr Yong sang for the outstanding and fast service recovery . Definitely a rescue if it’s not because of him I’d be leaving the reviews with 1 star .",,,,875,129,100
Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy,4.0,"5,578 reviews",#84 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,We stayed at the Grand Mercure Roxy Park (as it's now called) for two nights in September 2004 and then again for one night in October.  We wanted a comfortable transit hotel to break the journey, with our two-year old, between New Zealand and Belgium.  The hotel is only a 10 minute shuttle drive from the airport (free shuttle!), has excellent facilities, is close to fantastic hawking areas for tasty laksas, and right across from the Parkway shopping mall, in walking distance from the East Coast Park.  Child-friendly (play room, kiddie pool), friendly staff, affordable room service, very spacious rooms, satisfactory pool area, an immaculate  guest self  service laundry (always keeping in mind that we're travelling with a two year old) -- transit heaven!  We will definitely stay, there again.  Please note that this may not be what you're looking for if you want the Orchard shopping experience, but for exhausted parents, en route half way the globe, it was a perfect place. ,…,This hotel is handy to the airport and has a hotel shuttle (free).  You just need  to go to the airport visitor information area and ask about it and they'll come and pick you up.  It's 10 minutes' drive from the terminal.  Having stayed previously closer to the town on the river, we thought we'd try this hotel and were not disappointed although if you want to go in to the city, you need to catch a bus nearby.  The beach is a short walk away and is lovely and quiet.  The shops seem to be mainly for the locals and we did not see any bargains here.    Buffet breakfast was $S36 each - more than adequate and most delicious.  Having stayed often in Accor's hotels, we have always been happy with them as we were with this one.  There are cheaper hotels in Singapore but,  like us, if, you just need to be handy to the airport and in a very spacious, comfortable hotel (with a bath), this could be for you.  The rack rate here is $S240 per room per night but you may get a better deal on the Net. ,…,This hotel is in between the airport and the city, about $15 by taxi but there is a free shuttle bus every 30 minutes if you let them know you are coming. This hotel is excellent value for money and an extensive breakfast is included. There is a pool and gym for guests to use, and many shops around the area including some in the hotel building. A big Mall linked by a walkway over the road from the hotel. I recommend the Chinese massage inside the hotel building, certainly revived my travel worn body after a fifteen and a half hour flight!!  The rooms were spacious and well appointed and very clean. Both our  ""non-smoking"" rooms smelled smoky and changing rooms was no problem.  I wish smokers would have a little more consideration, especially when most hotels have especially, allocated ""smoking"" rooms.  Towels are provided at the pool and you can have drinks or dinner at the bar beside the pool. Great pool-side barbeque available too, yummy! There was no internet access in our ""superior"" room, although the ""deluxe"" rooms had wireless access. We were able to use the hotel's ""business centre"" computer for $18 per hour. There is also a coin operated guest laundry which was greatly appreciated! (Pity more hotels don't offer this facility  instead of over priced in house services.)   We were able to stay in the hotel until 6pm on the day we left at no extra charge.   This was our last hotel before heading home to Australia after a five week holiday and countless hotels. It was a fitting end to a wonderful holiday and one of the best hotels we experienced all over the world. We wished we could've stayed longer than two nights!   Highly recommended! ,…,We stayed in 4 hotels in Singapore and Malaysia, all with 4 to 5 star ratings. All hotels except the Roxy had helpful enthuaistic staff and good food. All I can say about the Roxy was it was clean and handy to the airport. I waited for 20 mins to checkin and Reception was well staffed and not very busy. I was told a load of rubbish about problems with the room safe. For breakfast we were seated at a dirty table that was still in use by other guests (other guests were getting more breakfast). I asked for French Toast and was told unavailble except for special order to the Chef at additional cost ( all other hotels provided French Toast in Breakfast Buffet) Fruit juice glass had very sharp broken and chipped rim. Buffet food provided was no where near standard of food at other, hotels. ,…,I stayed at the Roxy for 1 week with my daughter (22). Check in was a breeze at 5.30 am in the morning after a very exhausting flight with Tiger Air, Our room was clean and comfortable with no complaints. Breakfast was fantastic with a large variety to choose from and a chef to cook your eggs just the way you want them. All the staff I dealt with were extremely helpful and courteous. I had read some previous reviews and was worried about booking at the Roxy but these were not experienced by me, I suppose you cant keep everyone happy all the time. The pool area was very inviting but we were too busy to use it as we were out and about most days. Even though this property is about 15 mins by cab to town, we did not feel deprived at all, the shopping centre opposite is massive and, by the end of our stay we still hadnt seen all the shops. The food court has heaps of variety, but our favorite was the hawker centre next to the shopping centre. My daughter had Yum cha every day from one of the traders it was about $7.00 and we could share that and have left overs. Each day we would buy a bubble tea with pearls for $1Au. We didnt use the cabs even though they were cheap we caught the bus opposite the hotel to Paya lebar MRT and from there we travelled all around singapore, including Changi Museum, a day trip to Malaysia, The battle Box and various shopping centres. Once we purchased our refundable MRT tickett there was no stopping us. I also borrowed the lonely planet guide from the local library in australia which was also helpful. At the end of the day it was nice to get back to the Roxy have a soak in the bath and fall into bed away from the hustle and bustle. Oh, that was after collecting a 1/2 price cake from the lobby as we went up to our room, yummy. The day of my birthday I returned to my room and there was a card from management and a cake with happy birthday written on the plate in pink chocolate, so nice. At the back of the hotel was an internet cafe I wish I had found on the first day it was extremely cheap and fast. The free shuttle to the airport was an added bonus which leaves every 1/2 hour, just be in the lobby 10 mins before. All in all a very enjoyable stay in Singapore and at the Grand mercure Roxy.,…","Mid-range,Family",9096,Agoda.com,220,16,94
Citadines Rochor Singapore,4.0,18 reviews,#224 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,The rooms are okay and the kitchenette is fine but the service is horrible. Doing my SHN here and the staff and management know that you can't change hotels so they don't have to do anything to retain your business. Definitely one of the worst serviced hotels in Singapore I have ever stayed at. Definitely will not stay here ever again.,We are currently serving our SHN at this property and I must say that for the purpose it serves, it is quite good.  We have a kitchenette and washer/dryer which alone makes a big difference when you can’t leave the room.  The place is clean and the beds are comfy.  It’s not luxurious in any way but quite practical.  We had an issue with our shower not draining well and maintenance came and fixed it straight away.  The one big issue I have with this property is their service in terms of sending deliveries to our room.  For the last three days, I have had to call guest services to enquire about my delivery that had been dropped off at desk 15-20 mins prior.  In each case, they sent it up moments later but I should not have to call and follow up.  It is unacceptable that our food, takes about as long  to come from lobby to room than it takes to actually arrive to hotel in first place.  I asked to talk to a manager about this situation and have yet to hear from one.,…,Pros + Good location + Tekka market just opposite + Brand new with a mall right below the hotel + Cozy room and comfortable bed + Great sleep quality + Room just the right size + Induction cooker in the room + Laundrette + Nice swimming pool  Cons - Could hear next door guests talking - No in-house kitchen,Disappointed in the ascott property., Property was not in line with the ascott standard that we know and the place was bugs infested. Only good for location and unfortunately will not come back here again.,As an Ascott group member, there are decent expectations of an Ascott experience in all the properties in which I had once stayed (Ascott, Somerset, Citadines).  Citadines Rocher (recently opened in 2020) was one of my top choices in having a local staycation because of its location and price range.  However, it was an overall disappointing experience, and here’s why:  1. No daily housekeeping service  2. Our bathroom door could not close. It was completely off the ledge.  3. Reception is busy all the time. Phone calls are often not answered  4. This hotel was most probably a designated hotel used for both Malaysian citizens who were unable to return home due to locked borders, as well as returning Singaporeans to serve their mandatory 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).   There were, confirmed COVID-19 cases within my period of stay. We were notified by a letter from the management. The least the management could do was to provide a mask or sanitizers to guests. We also chanced upon 2 medical workers fully donned in PPE escorted a guest to the ambulance. Scary stuff.  5. We took our own trash out of the room since day 1 of check-in. It was not cleared even upon checking out.  Dear Citadines Rocher, please review your services. I had absolute faith and would like to continue giving my support to Ascott despite this awful stay.,…",,,,257,53,100
Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore,4.5,322 reviews,#16 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay, Thai","Share, ,TLDR: Decent stay but overall not quite value for money. At this price, you’d expect impressive service and fantastic facilities/in-room hardware but unfortunately the hotel fell short of the mark.  Room is clean and new, but nothing stands out. Generally good quality breakfast, kitchen staff were on the ball but wait staff were harried and could barely cope with drink orders and dish clearing. Service was prompt but impersonal - check in staff failed to share details on where I could utilize the inclusions of afternoon tea, welcome drink and breakfast in my package. Sure, I could use common sense to figure out that tea and breakfast were in Greenhouse but I wasn’t told that I had to show a voucher for welcome drinks and this voucher was not passed to me. Likewise, I wasn’t told, that my dining credit could only be used at Greenhouse - I had to separately check on this with the operator and figure out that I had to explicitly tell the staff at check out that I was using my credits at lunch immediately after returning my room so they don’t check me out of the system. These are not things that guests should be reasonably expected to know and staff should make the stay a seamless experience by volunteering this information.  Lastly and most appallingly, ice water was not served at tea and lunch. In fact, our request for tap water was outrightly rejected at lunch. Utterly ridiculous in this day and age.,…,My and my partner had our dinner at the Greenhouse cafe on the 14th January.. The restaurant environment is a wow factor. The lightings, artwork, spaciousness and upholstery are aesthetically well balanced and comfortable place to be in.   Food was enjoyable and arrived in prompt manner but nothing is as important as being given the attention by Haidar and colleague Sally.   Thank you team for the evening.,We were dining in the greenhouse on 14/01 and were impressed with the interior design when we arrived. Food was recommended by Alvin, to be honest, he made an exceptional recommendations, namely Pad Thai & Tom Yum Kung (authentic Thai flavor) which I enjoyed the most!  Some other dishes like pizza, tandoori chicken were nice too! Friday’s evening can’t be better with a happy tummy.  A part of the food, we do enjoyed the service provided by Haidar and Sally (hopefully I got her name right, she is wearing a jacket), their extraordinary services made our dining experience even more delighted. We were so pampered by the friendly and professional service provided by the team this evening.  Overall ambience in the restaurant was pleased and a Friday evening worth to spend on.,It was an amazing staycation at Dusit Thani! Fantastic service by Haziq and he even gave us the opportunity to a late check out. And, the breakfast spread is just all time favourite! I can eat there all day , that's how good the breakfast are! We even had the dine in steak and pizza, and we were so tempted to order them again cos they were so delicious!!!! All in all, we had a great time there! we'll definitely come back real soon!,Fantastic service right from before I checked in. I called up before check in for some assistance. The hotline staff then got someone to call me back promptly to address my request. During check in, even though the app check in was done,  the lady who checked me in on 9 Jan 2pm was extremely helpful and friendly. I must say, EVERY staff from housekeeping , concierge to gym/pool counter staff and staff Greenhouse, Legends Bar and Tee Deck are really friendly, attentive, and always serve with a smile.  I did have some issues with the room aircon which sort of turn off by itself even before it reaches a lot temperature.  Technician came to do some vacuuming twice over the two days and it did not resolve the issue. I gave up but at 4am on last day when my friend woke up for toilet, break and off/on aircon again, it miraculously got  this is just a small matter . Just want to share this so the hotel can perhaps do a thorough servicing of the patio pool facing twin room.   Your outstanding service , picturesque venue and the good food (Thai food was great!) is worth repeat visits.

ST Signature Chinatown,4.5,42 reviews,#66 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Stayed here for around a month from May to June before moving to the US, affordable price and friendly staff. The bed is comfy but a bit small for me a 6'1 tall person. Pillows need a serious upgrade tho! It is quiet and other people in the hotel are very friendly and quiet too. The location is convenient and easy to go to anywhere on the island. It is on a bright and wide street across from the temple. I will recommend anyone who is on a budget. The downside is there is no washer and dryer and the kitchen is closed due to covid.,Great location in the central region of Singapore with convenient transportations and tons of eateries and malls nearby. The co-living spaces, e.g., kitchen and toilets are clean and well maintained. Highly recommended for solo travelers.,Stayed for over a month. It is clean and the staff are kindly and helpful. The location is excellent and within working distance to the marina bay area. It is easy to find lots of delicious food nearby. Last but not least, affordable price!,Great place to stay, facilities provided are good and the room is clean and well maintained. Good price if you are on a budget and looking for a somewhere comfortable to stay at. Would definitely come back next time.,Good location and clean rooms as well as very cool bathrooms.But the doors are too close to each other so when someone knocks on the neighbor's door, we mistaken it as our own.

"KeSa House, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood",4.5,128 reviews,#40 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,Booked the room for convenience; shuttling to & from SGH while mom was hospitalised. Small but yet very cozy. Love the decor. Installing a bidet in the bathroom will be a great plus.  Loved the way the hotel provides empty glass bottles and refilling of water in the kitchen rather than supplying plastic bottled water in the rooms. Will definitely come back!,Truly a stand-out shophouse hotel the lively Keong Saik, with fantastic staff :-) The space felt extremely clean and fresh, loved the hotel’s colour scheme and the fragrance on each level too. The cosy standard room is well-designed with good storage, mood lighting and a smart layout. Beds were firm and comfortable. Thank you Salina, Kimberly and Nicole for the service and warm/friendly welcome and lovely birthday card/“cake” in celebration of my sister’s birthday! The housekeepers were lovely and helpful as well. Thanks KeSa!,The stay at the hotel was enjoyable, the hotel staffs were friendly and nice. Our room had a balcony which allowed star gazing at night. Overall, it was an awesome stay! Hotel staffs even prepared a card and flower petals for celebration.,Stayed for 3D2N with my hubby to experience our local boutique hotel.   Pros: - The lobby smell was heaven! - The receptionist Ms Sandy was a great help. I made the wrong booking but she was so efficient to help me rectify the problem quickly. - There's lift in the building, laundry, common kitchen (closed during Covid), smart tv in the room (no issue with connecting to tablet/phone). - Lots of cafe and restaurant around the premises, can explore great food there.  Cons: - Small bathing space (note: door couldn't closed fully so water will seep out). - Thin wall, literally could hear what my neighbours were busy doing :( ,Great location with lots of food options around the area.

Strand Hotel,3.5,607 reviews,#160 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I booked this hotel “Strand Hotel Singapore” for 2D1N from 9-10 Aug 2021. I was highly disappointed that the Aircon was not working at all. I was first assigned room 312, then 404 then 313 where I was told by the reception that some renovation is going on and the Aircon is not working well these days. And they can only give me a room change of up to 2 times. In all 3 rooms, the Aircon was poor and I was sweating inside the room. (No fan inside). They did not offer a refund or a change of hotel as well. I have booked numerous hotels through Agoda and I’ve never had a problem like this before. This is really very disappointing that I am forced to stay in a room where the Aircon is spoilt and there is no other alternative given from the hotel. Please stay here at your own risk.,Stayed at Strand Hotel in late November 2020 for a friend's impromptu birthday ""staycation"". Booking of the hotel was done via Booking.com and the check-in process was painless.   Got the Family room so all 4 of us could be in 1 single room without the hassle of needing 2 separate rooms. The size of the room was good, fitting 2 x Queen size bed and 1 x fold-able bed.  The interior of the room is a little old and outdated, the carpet felt a little moldy to the feet, hence I wore the disposable bedroom slippers while I was in the room. Toilet is a little cramped, but functional - the provided bath towels, and toothbrush but there was no hand towels.  There was room service in the afternoon when I requested for an Ice bucket to be sent up to the room (which came in a Green plastic, soup bowl), but when we requested for more Ice to be sent up to the room around 10pm, we were told to come down to reception to check - ultimately, we went to 7-11 at Peace Centre to buy a bag of Ice.,…,Good location. Room is clean and has the basic amenities. Had breakfast at the Strand Cafe. Breakfast menu is very limited but the staff at Strand Cafe provided excellent service. Can tell that he really take pride in his work.,Stayed here for 1 night in late March in an effort to escape the noise of kids at home all day. Room was fairly small at 18sqm and was simple but clean and functional and in reasonable condition. Combined shower / bath, but with a very low shower head *(unless you're a dwarf perhasp). Soap dispensers for shower and basin. No hand towels provided. Queen size bed. Fridge and tv in room. Quite noisy from neighbours: thin walls meant sounds of talking and using the bathroom plus slamming doors. Staff were quite terse and abrupt. Ok value for money at $62 on Agoda, but one night was enough for me.,We never got to stay at this hotel as our cruise got halted early due to the virus. The reason I gave it 5 stars was got the quick response I got to my email telling them we would not be there. The refund was in my bank account in no time at all which I really appreciated as I couldn’t really remember my booking details, Thank you and we will try to book with you again in the near future","Mid-range,Family",4359,Booking.com,309,56,100
Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar,4.0,343 reviews,#108 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I checked in my domestic helper at Aqueen Paya Lebar on 8 Jan 2022 for her to serve out her 7-day SHN or quarantine as required by Singapore authorities. I am disappointed at the service.   When I got to the reception, there were 3 (or 4) ladies. They knew I was there. There was no other guest checking in or checking out or making enquiries. It’s just me and my two domestic helpers standing in front of them but we were totally transparent to them.   They were not eager to greet me nor bother that we were there. In fact, it seemed that we were an intrusion to whatever they were doing. I got a bit angry so I asked them if they were going to check us in. Two of them looked annoyed at my question. Throughout the process not one of them smiled at all.   Are the days when the, hospitality sector prides itself with good service gone? One would expect that a guest walking into the hotel would be greeted with alacrity and a smile. But not Aqueen Paya Lebar. Guests were apparently an intrusion.   What annoys me more is whether we were treated this way because the guest is a domestic helper and she was on SHN? I hope not. A domestic helper is here to work and she is a paying guest. There’s no reason to treat her like she is entering a prison to serve her sentence.   And that’s not all. As I drove out of the car park, the IU scanner didn’t work. So the car park fee could not be automatically deducted from my cash card. That’s fine. It happens sometimes even at malls or other places. I thought I just needed to insert my cash card into the car park machine. Apparently Aqueen Paya Lebar’a car park is the most advanced in Singapore. It doesn’t  accept cash card. It has either to be some NETS card or a flash card.   I have been driving for 20 over years around Singapore and I’ve been using a cash card in my IU for the last umpteen years. And whenever the IU scanner failed to deduct the car park, all unneeded to do was to insert my cash card into the machine. But Aqueen Paya Lebar’s car park design is way ahead of the rest of Singapore, including 5-6-star hotels like Marina Bay Sands or Raffles Hotel and Ritz Carlton. These hotels still stuck using cash card apparently.   So I pressed the button on the car park machine for help. Unfortunately one of the earlier frowning face lady receptionists came back. She was obviously unhappy that she had to come to the hot car park entrance. Not a smile again. There’s no: “How can I help you? Sorry for the inconvenience.” It’s more like, “What the hell you press the button for?! Are you retard or something?!”   Anyway she took my card and tried to shove it into the bar code scanner. My gosh. She shoved a cash card into a bar code scanner! I’m totally baffled and bewildered. It’s a cash card that we insert into a slot which was clearly missing from the machine.   In the end she had no choice but to use her own card and let me out. Immediately after scanning her own card, she turned her back to me and walked off. There’s no “Thank you. Hope to see you again. Sorry for the inconvenience.” It’s clear she was saying, “Please don’t ever visit again. You owe us $2.00 for the car park, you cheapo.” Without a smile, she turned her back and walked off.   I thought perhaps I caught the concierge at a bad time. But no. Aqueen Paya Lebar’a hotel service continues to amaze me.   On the second day of my helper’s stay, I checked in on her. And I found out that even when the SHN guest puts the empty water bottles outside the room, the hotel housekeeping does not automatically send water up to the room.   So the guest is expected to live on two bottles of water provided by the hotel for 7 days. She has to live like a camel and try and store the water somewhere in her body and use it for the next 7 days in SHN.   Even a 2-star hotel will send up a bottle of water to their SHN guest everyday.   While many of us will probably buy some water from a convenience store in case the two free bottles are not enough but guests who are on quarantine or SHN are not supposed to leave their hotel room at any time at all. The hotel staff are very well aware of this restriction as any breaches by the guests could implicate the hotel. So how could she buy water when she has run out of it.   When I called the hotel and asked, I was told the SHN guest has to call and ask for water. What??? Placing the two empty bottles outside the hotel room door is not enough to tell you that she has no drinking water in her room? And knowing that she is on SHN is not enough to tell you that she couldn’t get any water in her own. She has to call? What? Is she expected to try and create drinking water in her room first, failing which she then calls you for water?  Come on Aqueen. The guest is on SHN and being a domestic helper, she is not your well-traveled guests from exotic countries. But remember this: she is a paying guest. She is not a free loafer.   If you only welcome certain types of guests to your hotel, you could have said so and I would have chosen another hotel for my domestic helper to serve out her SHN.

I love the hotel room that was given to me, it is a corner room and i have big part surround by window and views.  The room is clean and the bed is super soft and comfortable.   The fridge is not cold enough.  I couldn't adjust for hot water when i am showering. Turn here and there still cold water.   There is a convenient store, located beside the hotel, in the Shell Petrol Station, which sell a lot of things.,Booked a room on the day of. Hotel room was really lovely albeit small but comfortable! The tv doesn't have cable and the bed was a little uncomfortable but it was alright.   Our room had a balcony with chairs but for some reason it was locked and front desk confirmed that it was supposed to be locked.   Receptionist at check in was friendly and was patient with us when my friend could not find her ic for a minute and even suggested alternative ways such as using singpass app to check in.   Overall it was a pleasant stay with no complaints. ,Staff is very polite & professional, no need to followup requested service. I stayed there amidst COVID-19, I was really worried about precautions to avoid from get infected. But they had maintained good hygiene practices including temperature screening & sanitizers. Also enjoyed breakfast... its delicious with multiple choices.,Overall it great stay for me and my wife, we check in late midnight, fast response by the front desk name by shidah if i not wrong, small room but it fine for us to stay, the room was clean and tidy, thanks q so much Aqueen Hotel Paya Lebar, will come back again surely ","Business,Modern",6181,Agoda.com,68,5,73

So Far The Room Was Great, Sure Will Come Back Thumbs Up 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Will Recommend To Other. Thanx Q Champions Hotel Keep Up Your Service..Guest Will Come Back For The Service,I actually enjoy my stay there over the weekend. The location is very good, walking distance to Payar Lebar MRT station, located right on the Joo Chiat St., directly opposite Fairprice Supermarket. The room was clean, except the toilet bowl wasn't clean thoroughly, there were pee stains on the sitting plate. The bed is firmed. The hairdryer in the room is not working, but I am able to borrow one from the reception. With the price I paid and with its location, it is really good place to stay to explore Joo Chiat/Katong.,Suite room for $109 SGD, no breakfast. Prepaid on Agoda. Some minor hassles at checkin with a request for a $50 cash deposit (nothing mentioned about this on the Agoda email, nor any option of taking a credit card pre-authorisation), but relented after some discussion. Located towards Geylang Serai end of Joo Chiat. Suite room was large and seemed recently renovated and was clean with a comfortable king size bed. But the room was on the corner on Joo Chiat with very poor sound insulation: bad traffic noise throughout the day and night. Minor points were poor quality towels, no hand towels provided and no hand soap. 2 small bottles of mineral water provided and a small fridge. Free WiFi worked fine for Netflix.,It was a nice and clean hotel in 10-15 minute taxi from the airport. Shopping center, market, restaurants are located nearby. We are satisfied with one night stay for transit.  シンガポールでの乗り継ぎ時に利用。空港からもタクシーですぐ、近くにショッピングセンター、市場、たくさんのレストランがあります。部屋も十分な広さ、設備と清潔さでした。,I stayed there with my 2 big kids.  Hotels in Singapore are very expensive. So I would say this hotel was (about $25 GRAB ride to the airport and $18 from Clarke Quay by GRAB ) reasonable to stay in triple beds in a bedroom for $125 per night. No window, no fancy facilities or anything but that is what u pay for.... the front desk guy was nice gave me a fluffy doona when I asked for an extra pillow to sleep with.(they don’t have any extra pillow in stock) 7-11 and some kind of Malaysia type of food stalls were in vicinity. We arrived nearly 9pm to just to sleep before the early morning flight..... we bought lots of food @ 7-11’s though none of them were good. Ham lettuce and chees sandwich was not atable,teriyaki chicken mayo onigiri (rice ball covered by seaweed) was looked, like tuna and did not taste like it supposed to be.

Furama City Centre,4.0,"3,337 reviews",#118 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,FURAMA CITY CENTRE.  Firstly, let me say that with all the conflicting reports about this hotel in this forum, I was not sure what to expect. My wife and I stayed in room 1817 (room seventeen on floor 18) 3rd-11th June 2006.  My thanks to the correspondent who suggested a room well away from the elevators. I requested a quiet room in just such a position when we checked in. The man at the front desk spent some time on his computer and then said, yes, he was able to do so and that we were to be ""upgraded"". This was a complete and pleasant surprise. We were then asked if we would like a door ""key"" each. They are swipe cards and we happily agreed. We also were presented with a voucher for a non-alcoholic cocktail each. So far so good.  Alighting from the lift I noted there were no, bad smells (it was a non-smoking floor) and my wife noted that the carpet was showing it’s age but was still quite serviceable. We found our room to be clean, bright, tidy and with a view over a park-like square and directly above the hotel’s swimming pool, twelve floors below. A complimentary bowl of fruit was yet another pleasant surprise. Being double glazed and second-to-farthest from the elevators, the room was incredibly quiet throughout our eight night stay, fire alarm false-alarm excepted! The bed was huge and the controllable air conditioning made for peaceful sleeping. The programmable in-room safe was also appreciated. An electric kettle (tea, coffee, green tea and milk substitute provided daily, T.V. with remote, ironing facilities with a pull-out clothes line over the bath and a separate shower cabinet all helped to make for a comfortable stay. The in-room computer cable option was not required by us. Lace curtains and heavy drapes moved easily and would enable a sleep-in as they kept out the light very well.  We were happier with the location between China Town and the river, and the hotel itself over our stay last year at the Albert Court near Little India. The MRT station China Town is very close and can be accessed through an overhead bridge and air-conditioned shopping complex if preferred to the heat or rain outside. Ditto the bus stops.  Travel via bus and MRT is made so much easier if you obtain an EZILINK card from any MRT station office. This smart card is swiped on entry and again on exit from the station or bus and the balance is briefly displayed. For those on a budget and staying a few days, it is so much more convenient than sorting out the correct money in an unfamiliar currency when you have others waiting to also board a bus.  Eating was our primary reason for our Singapore holiday and the Hawker Markets were no disappointment. We actually experienced the very last working day of one of them and were afterwards directed to the new replacement centre which was in modern surroundings. The food no doubt will be as good but the ""atmosphere"" is likely to be lost forever. Our favourite Hawker Centre would be the radially laid out Lau Pa Sat about ten minutes brisk walk from the hotel.  Before our trip we borrowed from our library the latest copy of the Lonely Planet guide book and had it for reference. It is very helpful in giving bus and MRT details for places of interest thus we were able to use public transport with confidence, including our MRT trip to the airport when we were heading home.  Upon checking out (12.00 noon was our check-out time), we were in for yet two more pleasant surprises. The same clerk who checked us in was on duty so we opted to deal with him. He asked us what time our flight was. When told it was not until the evening, he immediately extended our check-out time to 15.00hrs. The second surprise was the offer to call back late in the day whereupon a complimentary shower would be made available.  For anyone looking for a conveniently placed, moderately priced, well-appointed, well-serviced hotel in Singapore, then we would recommend the Furama City Centre. We found all the staff we encountered to be polite and helpful. The only doubt we have pertains to two postcards, left for posting with a doorman, with two dollars for postage. Neither one to N.Z. nor the other to Australia have yet arrived. On another day, others sent the same way did arrive. I suggest do your own posting just to be sure.  We filled out a detailed hotel questionnaire on leaving and a few days after arriving home, received a comprehensive reply by E-mail, thanking us for our comments and stating that the Jacuzi at the swimming pool had been fixed. This was the only item we found not working. The pool itself and the gymnasium equipment were just fine, the pool having recently been renewed. One tip though: change in your room: the changing sheds are dingy and dark; they NEED updating. By choice our booking did not include hotel meals so we can not comment on this aspect. Our budget went so much further by eating out where the locals eat.  It was 25 - 35 degrees throughout our stay and we arrived home to Christchurch to snow on the ground and only 2 degrees!  Richard and Sue. New Zealand. ,…,Tried dinner buffet at tiffany cafe restaurant at furama city center. Booking was made by singapore local agent and me and my friends were pleased with the service. Its our first time here and we are happy and never regret,Just came today at furama city centre and we approached together with my two workmates iat the reception to register.

Bliss Hotel,4.0,806 reviews,#113 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Burmese, Filipino","Share, ,This is my first trip to Singapore. I used this as my SHN residence for one night as I came via a VTL flight. The staff were lovely and very helpful when it came to covid matters. The facilities were also great, the bed was prefect and the bathroom was excellent. Very clean and had good amenities available without having to leave the room. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends, it’s in a great location.,The staff at the hotel were brilliant. I needed to drop my bags off early before check in time and they took them with no issue. They also text me before my check in time, telling me my room was ready and that I could check in early.  The room itself is a good size with a huge king size bed. One downside is that I was very close to the elevator and it made quite a loud beep when it reached a floor. There was also a small bit of noise from other rooms but nothing major.  Very centrally located, just next to MRT. There are also many restaurants and bars nearby.,The room given was very clean and very cozy; bed was comfortable.  Only thing maybe for a double room, is good to have 2 chairs and not only 1 :P  Service was direct to point with no hassle.  Room was bigger then what I expected.,The suite room was huge, the bathtub was nice but didn’t really have the time to use it.   During check in, the receptionist FORCED us to place a deposit even tho we requested to close the minibar and mentioned we wouldn’t take anything. We requested for the manager and she blames it on hotel policy if not we are not allowed check in. Very bad service.,The location is superb, just opposite Chinatown MRT exit E. Our room is spacious, come with 2 bedrooms, 1 king size and 2 single beds. Housekeeping and services provided were prompt.  The minus point is the king size bed linen got a funny smell. Also, when we bathe, the water will splash to toilet area, it will be good if can put up a shower curtain.  Nevertheless, i will consider yr hotel again for the next staycation.","Value,Centrally Located",5705,Agoda.com,641,104,100
YOTEL Singapore,4.5,"3,669 reviews",#87 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid private parking on-site,"English, Chinese","Share, ,My second stay at YOTEL Orchard and I really enjoyed my experience here. From the quick and seamless check-in / check-out done by the Mission Control team (I didn't catch his name but he has green highlights :)) Made me feel welcomed and warm. When I called for disposable cutleries to be sent to the room, the team that answered the call had a friendly tone and as someone who has terrible anxiety with making phone calls, I felt relaxed. I was greeted by the robots and it was a unique experience for me. My experience at the bar was also amazing with friendly service from the bartender and order taker . Cleanliness of room is also immaculate. All in all, a 10/10 from me :) Would definitely recommend YOTEL to my peers! Thank you for the pleasant stay! ,Room was small upon first impression but the futuristic interior design was thought through, having smartbeds/tv to utilizing space very well (that a full-length ironing board could fit in without cramming the place). Full bottles of shampoo/conditioner etc were surprisingly provided instead of your typical small samples, and the toilet was so clean and cosy w a view of the cityscape and hot water (don't worry you can pull the blinds down for privacy when taking a dump).  YOSHI the robot was so cute and had a personality: It went, ""May the force be with you"" and ""Hasta La Vista, baby"". Didn't manage to meet YOLANDA though :( We had trouble trying to connect our device to the tv (it only streamed music and not videos??) so would be useful to have a thorough guide somewhere., Overall, we'd definitely come back and this experience is for people who are open to a concept-based room since roomspace is small.,…,Room was small and compact with barely space for luggage. Very compact size. Interesting concept of gliding bed with button by the side. For 3 pax, it was small Queen bed with a single bunk bed on top. 2 kind of blinds (dark and light) at the bathroom with shampoo, conditioner and shower cream. Got hand sanitizer, toothpaste, toothbrush, hand soap, hand lotion by the sink, plus paper cups, iron, and hair dryer in drawers. Got USB ports under the TV and next to the phone. Call 30 for complimentary bottled water if the 3 bottles next to the TV were not enough. Will be delivered by the in house robot. Free WiFi.,I am not sure if the smart bed was supposed to be stuck halfway and not being able to go all the way down or straighten it - which caused me to have back pains after sleeping, thus resulting in really poor sleep quality.   Also, the lack of shower curtains made the stay really inconvenient as I was staying with a friend. Well if you're ok with seeing your friend's body then maybe not a problem for you.   The HDMI/USB port on the wall was also faulty and the engineer told us to connect the HDMI straight to the TV.  The room was already small, putting the laptop on the foldable chair makes walking around the room very very inconvenient.  On top of those listed, the request for amenities needed to wait for an hour because there were only 2 robots.  Supposed to be a staycay to rest,, ended up more tired. ,…,Although the cabin was quite small, it was just nice a fit for 2-3 guests. The overall comfort level was good and it was at a very good location. The robots which they utilized to transport up extra towels/water was really cool! ","Trendy,Modern",7004,Agoda.com,416,69,100

Overall a superb way of enjoying 5 star hotel services but with more independent living and laundry facilities. I would highly recommend 👍.,…,I was checking in at the hotel together with my family and the hotel staffs were excellent and polite.

It has a jaccuzzi and good view of the Bugis area.  Parking can be challenging as they only have four free slots.  But it is near MRT and also buses serve the area well.

Con is poor interior sound proof, door banging when neighbour closing, can hear next room knocking sound. ,Is this hotel? Lollllllllllllll they gave me the FIRST FLOOR ROOM RIGHT BEHIND OF THE RECEPTION. I totally feel like I’m doing the room rental with hotel receptionist. I paid 73SGD for superior double room, but what i got is very small tiny room which located at the 1st floor and I could hear all the noises coming from outside of the road.  I requested to get a better room at 4th floor and I have paid 30$ for room upgrade, But the room at 4th floor’s air conditioner was leaking and all the water was dripping from the aircon.  Floor was so wet, balcony window was opened during raining, all the rains come in to the room. I called housekeeping and receptionist, but the receptionist just repeated same thing which is she doesn’t know anything. It was really insane and awful, experience.  They shouldn’t promote the name as hotel cuz IT IS MOTEL. The fat receptionist lady was really really rude and she being sarcastic to me by saying “Are you local? you are not right~?”. I totally do not understand what’s the point for this question? I will report this to MOM as she behaved like a racist.  Guys, if you don’t want to mess up your mind, PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE.,…,Compared to most hotels in Singapore, this is on the small side, which is a plus point for me. Rooms are a fair size, and were clean. Water and coffee etc were provided. The hotel sits on the edge of the vibrant Arabic quarter which is a big plus, as there are plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes to choose from. Buses leave nearly from the doorstep and trams are a five minute walk.  The pool on the roof is small, but lovely and immaculately clean, and you can listen to the prayers from the nearby mosque, and look at the high rises while swimming. Pretty good. The reception staff could be friendlier, and the rooms can be noisy.,Due to the corona virus all my flights got cancelled all other hotels were kind enough to reschedule the booking or offer a refund, but this hotel, singapore has cancelled flights from China,  but they refuse to change the dates ... utterly disappointed and would never use them again.... keep away ....","Family,Centrally Located",5307,Agoda.com,402,71,100

Room is small but cozy bed, comfortable and quiet. Staffs are friendly and warm welcome. Eco Loft single room without hair dryer.I recommend for deluxe or window room that more light from outside. It's good memory for me here.This is good choice for comfortable and quiet hotel.,Location is fine, between two subway stations at the north side of little India. It’s clean and friendly. The only con is the size of the standard double room. It’s impossible (and when I say impossible, I mean impossible) to bring two big luggages in the room. Me and my girlfriend had only one luggage, and it was almost fine. ,I stayed in superior twin room for 2 nights  i'm quite particular about the hotel i wanted to stay in every cities i visited. It must has good value, rather centrally located, good reviews for cleanliness and good access to public transportation. and Hotel YAN does not dissapoint.  ROOM Yes, it is small. but this is singapore, you'll hardly get a good size with such small prizes. My room has twin bed with large window and balcony access. there are not much room to keep luggage, so best not to bring too much of luggage when you stay here. Bed is very comfy, linen is super clean and they provide extra pillow if needed. Room lightning is a bit darkish / yellowish due to the color of the darkish grey wall and tiles. There are universal power plug near the beds, so you don't have to, bring adapter. TV is very sad, they only show 8 local channel. There is small refrigerator with free minibar! (2 can of cokes, a small bag of chips and two small bag of M&Ms chocolate), and this minibar is refill everyday! how generous! Dilmah Teas and Instant Coffees is also provided, of course with water boiler.  BATHROOM bathroom is separated by curtain from the bedroom. Its super clean. the toilet has shower bidet (We asian loves this!), and the separated shower room has rainshower. Water heater work well, but there was only one day when i smell some stink, probably from the sinkhole, but it quickly went away. The provided toiletries is complete and of good quality, they even give a recycled toiletries bag for free! (and again replaced everyday!). Towel is thick and comfortable. you can request hairdryer from receptionist. This is a 4 star quality bathroom!  LOCATION about 500-600 meter from Bendeemer MRT (blue line) and Lavender MRT (green line), and 400 meter to bus station, No 145 bring you to many places central, including vivocity for universal studios. When coming from airport using MRT, stop at Lavender and go straight north. There are two local and cheap eateries nearby. A small seven eleven nearby too. 500 meter to city square mall, about 750m to Mustafa center, the largest cheap megastore in Singapore.  Its very quiet at night.   FACILITIES i dont think they have gym or pool or business center. wifi is provided is okay speed, sometime can be slow. The hotel lobby has many chairs, very comfortable! i usually sit there for a while before going up to my room.  STAFF Super Friendly! singapore is notorious for its grumpy service sometime, but staffs at Hotel YAN is incredibly friendly. They will warmly greet you whenever they see you. And i would like to mention Jasmine for her kindness handling our luggage, and help taking our photos!  I highly recommend hotel YAN for its value, cleanliness and top service.,…,Hotel Yan has one very rude male staff (spencer chua) at the hotel during day time,  very pushy guy, he wanted me to upgrade my room and I refused to do so because I didn't want to pay more because I was leaving soon so he gave me the snobbish look the whole time I stayed there, not to mention he was racist to me after he scanned my passport and whispered to another staff about my nationality,  he also never greeted every time I walk in or out the hotel..  If I had not pre-paid for few nights for the room, I would straight away cancel my booking and move to different hotel! I actually didn't mind paying extra for nicer hotel with better service! Totally waste of money and time!,My mom and i stayed at this hotel on 17th to 20th. We were excited to stay here at first, but everything changed when we get the room (404). We found medium sized cockroach creeping on our curtain right away we opened the door. I asked the receptionist to get a new room which was dusty as if they haven't cleaned it. The person in charge just kept on apologizing till it gets so annoying. On 20th when we checked out, the reception guy didnt have good work ethic at all.

Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5,976 reviews,#51 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,Was allocated Orchard Hotel Singapore for my 21 days of quarantine. The last 21 days wasn’t the easiest but I am extremely grateful to two helpful individuals that went out of their way to make my stay a better one. Thank you Mr Quam Kponton (Front Office Manager) and Ms Nithya (Duty Manager I believe) for going above and beyond your call of duty.   I had a severe allergic reaction in my room on my first day of arrival and had to teleconsult my doctor as we aren’t able to step out of our room during our SHN period. Initially in the evening, I wasn’t able to get the help I needed and I had to put up with the night. However my allergy reaction got so bad in the middle of the night that I had to called the call centre at 4am for assistance. I am so thankful for Ms. Nithya who tried, her very best to get me the items I needed and even ensure follow up assistance was given properly. Not forgetting Mr. Quam who had been taking care of me throughout the 21 days of my SHN and checking on me and my condition - both of you are truly gems of Orchard Hotel!,…,We stayed at the Orchard Hotel en route to Europe and now on our return trip. The Hotel is excellent, we’ve had great rooms and friendly, helpful service from Staff, and the proximity to Orchard Road makes visiting shops and great eating a very short and comfortable walk away. Highly recommended!,One of the best properties on orchard road, rooms are bit small with everything one need,they provide a cell phone free in rooms which one can use it for local and international calling for free. Stayed 3 nights,breakfast was good with limited choice for vegans.they have fully equipped fitness centre at level 4 and a nice pool too. ,Stayed here for quarantine, would not recommend for anything, and especially not staycations. Totally does not look like pictures! I've stayed in a lot of hotels the last 2 months and this was by far the worst. Even smaller than what I stayed in in Europe (does not even have a sofa! I felt quite claustrophobic being in there 2 weeks) and room is dated in spite of supposed recent refurbishment. I suspect they included the size of the long corridor in the room size, but it's not like anyone hangs out in the corridor. If anything it's an inconvenience.  Toilet smelled even on day 1. AC does not go above 25C so if you're cold you have no choice. Asked for help, they sent a technician down who told me switch on all the lights, as light emits heat... seriously... Front desk doesn't, always pick up. Lunch is served late at like 230pm or 830pm, usually I just order because I can't wait so long. I think the only advantage is that its cheaper than other hotels in the area, but since it seems quarantine guests are paying above average room rate and don't have a choice we are kind of stuck, but I suppose that's a unique situation. This quarantine experience at Orchard Hotel made a very poor end to everything and I hope they stop placing people here as quarantine is already an unpleasant experience. I do think people would pay more for a nicer hotel. I would. Plus sides are staff are polite and restaurant food is pretty good. I guess I would call this hotel a budget choice if you're a tourist wanting to be in a hotel in Orchard, personally not anywhere I'd stay willingly. ,…,stayed in this property in feb 2020. very sophisticated and charming. the location is fantastic, right on the orchard street which is the heart of Singapore. the rooms are done nicely and the service is great. the highlight of our stay was the robotic services where literally the robots are at your room service, saving bottles of water and also making eggs at the breakfast buffet. the breakfast spread could be improved but would love to be there again.","Value,Business",11016,Booking.com,229,44,100

Relaxing. Many places to eat. Nice roof Swim pool. Near Beach well not so near but its there about. Good staff. Good price.   Too many words to write here trip advisor. Keep it 50-100. Still lagging need 100 more. My beer is finished still on this hahaha ,This is an old hotel in a great location with a rooftop pool, and lots of great restaurants nearby. Easy access to East Coast Park and Beach, plus great night life nearby. They have spacious rooms and a nice pool which is on the rooftop, so overall a great city getaway for a cosy value staycation or traveller as you get to explore the Katong area,We can't speak highly enough of the hotel and the wonderful staff. They were all so kind and helpful to us when we stayed with our little girl. I recommend anyone to stay here. Thank you so much for your kindness.,Spotlessly clean rooms, great AC, hot and powerful showers and a bath tub. Mary on the front desk is wonderful as are her “bell captain” and the level 2 housekeeping team.  Best fridge ever in a Singapore hotel, a good size, really cold and it even had a freezer compartment.  Bed is quite hard but that suits me just fine.  Wifi overall was good although it did get a little slow in the evenings.  I didn’t use the pool. I had hoped to spend a few hours sunbathing but the area doesn’t really lend itself to that.  Great location near to many funky cafes and bars on East Coast Road and Joo Chiat Road.  The only tweak I’d like would be to have hand towels or smaller towels in the room too please.  Also, it’s worth noting that this hotel is not currently offering breakfast under, Singapore’s current coronavirus protocols.,…,Santa Grand is perfectly located if u r looking to feast and go cafe hopping as there are so many superb cafes,  bakeries and eateries right on East Coast Road.    We took the eat,stay,play package on the hotel website which was amazing value.  Paid only $105 inclusive of a $38 dine voucher at Platypus Cantina, the Mexican restaurant and bar downstairs. It serves delicious food and cocktails.  The deluxe room was spacious, staff very homely and friendly, and the rooftop pool was small but lovely. Do book asap the pool , as only 8 pple can be in the pool at any one time due to safe distancing measures.   Overall, Santa Grand exceeded expectations.",,13833,getaroom.com,182,18,94
YWCA Fort Canning,3.5,919 reviews,#142 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Charles, the banquet manager and all the staff who helped make my once-in-a-lifetime wedding dinner a smooth and memorable one. Charles has been exceptional and very accomodating to our requests, including our last minute dinner changes. On the event day, I was taken aback at how gorgeous the whole set up was. The food was perfect (as the bride I finished all the food except the 7th course because I was too full) and the female banquet staff even assisted me to hold my gown up when she observed I needed assistance. Thank you for the wonderful service and memories!,Appreciate the back and forth discussions by Johnny to ensure our group had a smooth time at YWCA. The arrangements were great. Thanks also to Luke for on the ground coordination. Much appreciation to the cafe staff (Kumar, 2 other ladies who I didn’t catch their names). They made meal times enjoyable with their friendly service even while keeping to current safety measures.,Brother had a wedding dinner at this hotel. I would like to thumbs up to the event manager, Charles, who had everything arranged and organised well-mannerly. His hosting and banquet crews are amazing too. All guest left the dinner with full tummy and very happy with all service.  Cheers!,The location is a good place for retreat for me and my friends. It is accessible from Dhoby Ghaut and allow us to go to the Fort Canning Park to walk around and have our own time of reflection at year end.   The staff there is friendly. Johnny is there to make sure that the group is comfortable and settled in. The rooms is simple, nice and clean. I think for this price that we got, it is worth the stay.,Big thank you to Johnny (Senior Sales Manager) and Team for their dedication and timely assistance in a recent youth retreat I planned for over 50pax at YWCA. Despite the multiple clarifications and changes made to roomings and dining, Johnny was extremely helpful and took extra effort to check in with us after our check in at hotel to ensure that we are ok and comfortable with the hotel arrangements and to see if further assistance is needed for our group.   The rates that were given for our stay was also very reasonably priced making our stay affordable for our group.

Venue Hotel The Lily,4.0,405 reviews,#124 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I am very pleased by all the staff everyone including the housekeeping. And personally Jeffery was very helpful as I accidentally drop a glass bottle which shattered to pieces and I informed him and he cleaned it up willingly and happily informimg me that it's part of his job. O believe all the receptionists throughout my stay have all be very pleasant and very helpful in anything needed. The room is also wonderful. And I can surf on YouTube as I fall asleep. There are also amenities around. All in all I'm very pleased with the services provided by all the staff throughout my stay.,The hotel staffs, Jeff and Rayson were helpful and polite. Theyre so nice towards all guests. The hotel is clean and tidy. Amenities around the hotel is good and I frequent this hotel because of the staffs. I would give 10/10 for their custoker service and a full rating for this hotel..,The good - location. Situated along Joo Chiat road where there's a lot of bars, pubs, cafes, restaurants and boutique shops. Facade is nice as it preserved the architecture of the old shophouses of colonial Singapore.  The bad - close to pubs/bars/KTVs where Vietnamese girls and old ""Uncles"" hangout. It can be noisy and fierce especially when Vietnamese girls fight over their man. Most rooms do not have windows and those that have are facing the windows of the condo behind it where you can literally say hi to each other.  The ugly -  I cannot sleep, repeat...I cannot sleep in peace. Apart from the noisy bars/pubs nearby, almost every other day, between 4.50am to 5.30am, there's a truck that comes with steel trolleys banging heavily on the road and the pavement. I think it's to, collect laundry. The another garbage truck that comes between 8am-9am which is slightly less noisy, So I cannot sleep in peace.,…,Being a regular customer here for last few years, it could be easily noticed that conditions of hotel are going down despite maintenance. A major retrofitting may be unavoidable. The main problems lie with ageing and deteriorating of equipment that nominal service will not help.  No. 1 - Air con is a deal breaker. Very poor circulation and thermostats control. Unpleasant to stay long in the room. This happened to 6 to 7 rooms stayed in recent years.   No. 2 - leaking shower cubicle when seal is rotten.  No. 3 - poor water pressure for basin. Water could be dripping at maximum   No. 4 - below average housekeeping. Cleanliness has not been kept to previous standard. Missing replenishment from time to time  No. 5 -  room has smoking scent. This happened rarely but not fixed despite, feedback   No. 6 - dated entertainment as without Netflix nor smart TV features as compared to Classic, hotel under same group but slightly higher category   Location is a killing point for this hotel so the above wish list items are significant to attract regular customers to return. ,…,Just returned from an 8 night stay.   We booked to visit family member in University. Didn’t need a fancy holiday hotel, so the Lilly fitted our needs fine. Staff very friendly and helpful. Location is the red light area of Singapore. A few bars that was obvious, but no issues. Many restaurants and lots of family’s and people around.  The only down side was no wardrobe in the room. All that was provided was a small rail above desk/vanity with 4 hangers, no doors or curtain. With 2 suitcases of clothing and no storage for the cases in a small room, it was a struggle. Room regularly cleaned and everything worked.  All in all great base to use for sleeping.  ","Budget,Modern",5991,ZenHotels.com,89,12,94
Hotel Grand Central,3.0,591 reviews,#283 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,Nice and friendly staff, given a room with a massive window up on the 9th floor so had a good view Orchard Road. Room was clean and well kept and a good size for the price. One minor issue is the bath/shower is small and I think elderly people may find this difficult to get in and out of.  The only reason I have not given the hotel 5 stars is due to poor staff communication before my stay. I travelled into Singapore using a VTL flight which landed in the morning - using the VTL you must isolate for the first part of your stay so I had booked the hotel for the night before so I could immediately isolate on arrival. I had tried to contact the hotel beforehand (~1 month beforehand) to let them know I would be arriving in the morning and I had tried to explain that I had booked the, room for the night before so I could go straight into the room for my isolation until I received my negative PCR result. They did not respond to my messages and in the end my partner had to call them and they said they had a made a note of my situation. However, when I landed in Singapore I found out they have cancelled my booking and charged my card. However, even though this was a little bit stressful it was all sorted out when I reached the hotel, they let me into the room and I paid the amount I was originally meant to pay.,…,We have booked a room with breakfast through Booking.com. The breakfast in this hotel was the worst experience I have ever had in hotel ever!! (I know this is a pandemic and the hotel kitchen is closed, but I have been in another hotel couple weeks ago and they were able to provide great breakfast regardless)  On the first morning we have received Chinese style breakfast - cold noodles with chicken wing. Talked to the receptionist and she changed our breakfast for western. Woke up to find dry toast bread with ham and cheese, fruit, soy drink and Spanish yogurt. The day after we received tuna croissant, some meat paste pastry and little raisin cake. Nothing was fresh at all. Talked to the receptionist again if it’s possible to get a refund and cancel the breakfast which was, declined because apparently we booked with Booking.com ? The receptionist than asked what we would like to have for breakfast. I have explained that all I want is fresh breakfast, fresh bread, maybe some ham and cheese, scrambled eggs, some juice, fresh croissants, butter, jam… just normal western breakfast. Since that day they gave us everyday the same cold scrambled eggs with piece of toast,piece of ham and toast style soft cheese, the same yogurt and 100ml canned juice that you can usually see in the airplane?  On arrival we have been given wrong room with double bed even though that we booked king size but the nice lady at reception gave us our room with no problem.  Overall its a nice clean hotel, but the breakfast are not worth it! Don’t waste your money and hotel management please don’t offer breakfast if you are not able to provide it.,…,My family and I stayed while waiting for our PCR results upon arriving in Singapore via VTL. The staff were very accommodating and welcoming. Benny, the operations manager, ensured we had a comfortable stay and went the extra mile to accommodate us. Thank you! ,Hotel is very clean, tidy and centrally located with facilities likeMetro, food court Staff is very helpful and polite and it’s manager Benny wing went extra mile to help to make my stay comfortable   I will surely recommend any one who is visiting singapore to stay this hotel,Booked the hotel for a staycation. Do note that not every room has a bathtub thus request has to be made if you prefer to have a room that comes with it, subject to availability. Else it would just be a standing shower.  Arrived a little early for check-in so left the bag at the concierge and went to grab a Thai lunch at Orchard Plaza located next to the hotel. Had quite an authentic pad thai, ice milk tea and fried chicken wings. It was an experience close enough to imagine that I was having the meal in Thailand.  Went back to the hotel and collected the card keys. The room was decent without the typical damp smell of old hotels.  Saw that the bathtub could barely fit 1 person. Yes, it was that small. Guessed it was added in during the hotel's renovation a few years back. Other, than that, the rest of the items were the usuals. The wifi was quite unstable and dropped quite a few times. The satellite channels on the television were not working. Guessed the hotel suspended the subscription due to covid-19 with few/ no international guests.  There was complimentary coffee and tea but they were just the mass market brands of 3-in-1 coffee sachets and tea bags. Water was from a hot and cold water dispenser which I thought was quite convenient and environmental friendly but not sure how regularly the filters within were cleaned.  Due to covid-19, bookings have to be made to use the swimming pool and gym. For the gym, only 1 fully vaccinated person could use it at any one time.   When it was time for the swim, there was no bathrobe in the room. Called room service and was told that they do not have any. Access to the pool was via a back-of- house lift next to the lobby where a staff was required to activate the lift to bring it to the roof level where the pool was. The pool was open to the sky thus it was quite therapeutic to float on the water, look at the sky and relax. Be careful when on the deck. Not sure why there was mimosa plants crawling about and I got my soles pricked. Had a good swim, took some photos and went back to the room to get ready for dinner. You could go back to your floor direct from the same lift.  Dinner was Korean pork kimchi soup and spicy shredded chicken with side dishes of kimchi and anchovies. The shop was located at another hotel opposite. Service was fast and in no time, dinner was self-served in the room.  After dinner, took a public bus to Little India 5 stops away to soak in the Deepavali festive mood. The crowd was like pre-covid and the Social Distancing Ambassadors could just staod there helplessly to watch. Had a sampling set of Indian sweets which was quite decent and not overly sweet.  Back to the room, some room amenities that could be included were a shower cap and some cotton buds.  The fridge was not too cold and definitely not freezing but it managed to chill my bottle of Moscato enough to sip while resting into the night.  If you have the habit of leaving a small light switched on when you sleep, you would find the lighting controls weird. Although you could leave the bathroom light switched on, the glass panel in between the bathroom and the room was clear towards the top and let the light glared through and the entrance light was connected to other ceiling lights in the room.  Oh yes. The door had 2 additional locks within with did not work. One was the roller door chain which did not have a chain. The other was a male-female door bolt but the male part was missing from the door. Relied only on the original door lock's double lock to secure the room for the night.  Overall, I gave my experience an average rating.  Good night!,…",Centrally Located,5181,Agoda.com,415,59,100

Put simply you book with a credit card guarantee,we arrived at 12.30am for a 1.00am checkin to find they had overbooked[how can you overbook with credit card deposit? ]the off hand checkin person took our booking number and said we would be ok to cancel??? and we would be refunded our money so off we went to find a quite piece of floor in the terminal to pretend to sleep for a few hours before our next flight at 9.50am. as of this date I am still waiting for the refund of my payment,you might be luckier than us but next time I will book Ambassador.,this was the 1st time i have stayed in the Aerotel I have tried both the other transit hotels at Changi and this one was very good. Sadly I was to tied to use the pool. The room was big and the two beds where nice and firm. I really wish they would put signs up reminding guests that it is a transit hotel! we all basically come here to sleep. People are very noisy as they clammer up the ""echo"" chamber of a hallway with unruly children and or talking loudly at some un godly hour.,Don't make the same mistake our travel agent did. If you book this hotel be aware that it is only for transit travellers who have up to six hours between flights. If you book thinking it is in on the first day and out the next, you will be disappointed. If you need longer than 6 hours, choose a different hotel.,We arrived in Singapore last night (27/7) after a 14 hour flight and cleared customs to pick up our bags, unfortunately this airport is located prior customs and bag collection. Beware you are not allowed back in without a new boarding pass, we don’t fly out until tomorrow and Qantas cannot provide a boarding pass, we called Aerotel and advised them we are outside and we were not able to re-enter, they said they can’t HELP and call bookings.com  I had booked two rooms and chose the “pay at hotel” option but Aerotel charged us straight after we reserved our two rooms on the 26th - so guess what? I just lost 2hours of my life and $327,  I wished I had read the reviews, this happens every day based on the reviews, I guess that is why Aerotel charge customers a day before arriving., What a scam!!!,…,This hotel is in the terminal.  Which means that you CANNOT get your checked bags.  Therefore it is ONLY really for those transiting on the same airline and have arranged for their bags to be stored / collected or those who have no checked bags.  We got caught out, when we arrived we asked 3 different people what we needed to do to get to the hotel and get our bags.  All said we needed to go to the carousel and get them.  This is of course after customs, and we found ourselves outside the terminal and not able to re-enter.  If you look at the feedback, this has happened to several people.  The confirmation that comes with you booking as one very small line that says “customers must not clear customs”. Ok I get that, but it doesn’t say “and you will need to do this and that with, your bags” or “if you have checked bags, don’t come to us”  I booked this months ago through booking.com and it was a non-refundable booking.  When we got to Changi, I doubled checked the booking.com app and there was nothing about not clearing customs.  The only place this information is, is in the email that I get many months ago.  I contacted the hotel and they said that they would not process a refund.  As the payment had gone through.  I am now $200 out of pocket.  Poor, poor stuff Aerotel - you need to clean up your act, this is DISGUSTING behaviour.  Make your information clearer put it in the booking.com “important information area” and let the customers know who really should make use of the hotel.

But this Hotel with fair size room is clean and tidy. Very helpful staff. Rooms cleaned and linen/towels changed every day.   Ideally located in Little India with Mustafa shopping 24/7 and several 24/7 eateries in this neighbourhood. It is still in the red light area but no hassles at all.  The rooms facing Kitchener road can be noisy even at midnight with some goons riding noisy motobikes at high speed even after 2:00am as windows are not double glazed. Double rooms S$110 nett/Family rooms S$130 nett.,The hotel gets an extra point just because of the location, would suggest this hotel to only those who are looking for a place to sleep at night after an exhausting day of Singapore visit. The hotel is very basic with small rooms as usual in Singapore and no fancy stuff. Now let’s get down to the breakup:  Location – excellent, diagonally opposite to one of the exits of City Square Mall. To reach here take the MRT and get down at Farrer Park MRT, take either exit ‘H’ or ‘I’ (Exit ‘I’ will take you inside the City Square mall, but is more closer to the hotel). Hardly 3 – 4 minutes’ walk from MRT including road crossing   Eating Options – no eating options within the hotel, but you get everything within 20 to 500 Meters of the hotel including street food, restaurants, cafes etc., In case if you still are looking for more options, City Square Mall is just in front.  Mustafa Market – is around 100 – 150 meters from the hotel, you get everything in this 24 hour super mart    Travelling to Singapore Attractions – Singapore has an excellent MRT and bus connectivity, as Farrer Park MRT in so close, just hop on to MRT to reach any of the tourist destinations in Singapore. Tourist pass is available at select MRT stations (including Farrer Park) which would cost you around 10 SGD, 16 SGD or 20 SGD for 1, 2 or 3 days unlimited rides in Singapore MRT and public buses respectively with an additional 10 SGD refundable security deposit, trust me these cards are huge boost for economic travel.  Hotel Staff – very nice and welcoming, they will answer all your queries regarding moving around in Singapore and sightseeing. Informative maps can be found at the reception.    Overall a good place to stay just because of the location and hotel staff.,…,Dear all I am not frequent person to Trip adviser and this hotel made me to strike this review, I think my experience may help for some people who really think that the hotel is very good as per review, I am really surprised and shocked how this Hotel has a 3 Star status. Broken chairs with unhygienic conditions and adamant nature of staff made me irritated. This hotel is not worth for the amount we pay. Really A disaster for me to see such situation. Beware and don’t trust the pictures in Any site which are not yet all true.....  Be careful before you choose. Sorry guys this review is with my experience only not to blame anybody... request to the management please try to  improve. One incident to your notice that a European lady begging the staff for hot water in toilet. Is it, right way to deal with the clients.we expect hygienic environment and little eminities that’s it.,…,I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my Family. This is one of the worst hotels I ever stayed in my life.I don't know how people post some good reviews here?? Bedsheets never changed and found hair all over at first day.The toilet is so small there is no space for any shower.If you are tired and wished to sleep, forget about it. You can hear everything that is going on in the next room.People coming late night and banging the doors are normal things.Staff is nice except one named 'Spencer"". I never deal with a rude arrogant person with the worst attitude.he felt like he owned this hotel and we are his slaves.We even witnessed he was yelling and arguing with a family with kids in front of others.There is no manager or anyone you can go and ask anything.If you are with the, family please stay away from this filthy hotel or you have to keep your kids away from the noise from the other room.,…,We have atleast 2 months to prepare for our SIN-KUL trip. I have to prepare the bookings and budget. So, I almost read every review of every budget hotel around. I'm having a hard time deciding which to choose coz almost all budget hotels has really unsatisfying review.  So, I gave this hotel a try. I booked thru agoda and hoping for the best. We arrived early at the hotel, around 11 in the morning before noon. The lady front desk check our documents and informed us that our room wasn't available yet but she said that once the other guest check out, she will have it clean right away. We decided to go roam around and left our luggages at the hotel (it is a plus to a hotel accommodation who accepts luggage storage whenever the guest arrived early or have an evening flight)., Actually, before choosing hotel, I was thinking of booking our accommodation with airbnb (condos for rent) but then we will not be allowed to left our luggages whenever we arrived earlier than the check in time.  Location: it is wise. Near littler India, lots of small resto beside it. We always eat in the beside resto of the hotel. They aren't bad it actually taste good and the food stalls owner are friendly (both singaporean and indian). So, food will not be a problem. If you are a bit of classy and want some fast food meals, this hotel got you covered. Coz across the street was the city square mall. Also, convenient stores are available  Transportation: Singapore is a really easy access in terms of transportation. But in this hotel, you can access the Farrer Road station of MRT line. But be sure to grab their map for the different MRT lines to make sure that you will get on the right track. Also, buses are convenient. 1 bus stop was around 5 mins walk but there's alao a bus stop around 2 mins walk near the hotel. It depends on the route of the bus. I suggest, to use the google map. It is very accurate from the number of the bus you have to take, from the minutes and stop of the bus and even if there's a seating or normally crammed standing.  Rooms: As I've seend from other reviews, they said that it is dirty, really small and AC is not working. But based on my experience, we booked a budget hotel so there's limit with the space but let me tell you this: the family room that we stayed is really much spacious they even have small refrigerator. They are also generous with the pillow, we have 2 pillows each (other hotel only have 1 pillow for each guest). AC is working fine, Television with fox movies. Bathroom, yep it is small but really functional.  Wifi: they only allowed 1 gadget per guest check in to use the wifi. Well, for that it really doesn't matter. Also, wifi is a bit fast compared to our signal from Philippines! 😂  Staffs/service: All of them are accommodating and really friendly. Always leave a smile to every guest.  Tip: to save some money, they refill the mineral bottle every day and they also have station for hot water, if you want coffee or tea. But for us, before going to bed, we fill up our thermos with hot water and left it open so that in the morning it will be cold and we can place it in the refrigerator and then it is ready to go.  Suggestion for the management: I really hope that you can put water dispenser in every floor. So that you don't have to refill the water bottles in every room. This will saves mother earth. Coz after we check out, all we had was empty 1 used bottle container that goes directly to the trash.  Lastly, if I will be given an opportunity to go back to Singapore, I will definitely book again in this hotel. Thank you so much!,…","Centrally Located,Family",,,336,25,99
The Porcelain Hotel,3.0,988 reviews,#218 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,I made a reservation in agoda for porcelain hotel and I called the staff at the porcelain hotel to cancel the reservation and they said that they will cancel the reservation. However to my shock i received a change on my credit card for the reservation. When I called the hotel again, the hotel staff justin han was not helpful, he could not check my reservation and told me that the hotel cannot do anything about it, and that he doesn't know how to proceed with the matter. I am disappointed that after a few stays with porcelain hotel i had such a nasty experience from the staff, who cannot trace my previous conversation with their staff, accused me of calling the wrong hotel and made it my fault when I followed the relevant processes. Please advise how I can follow up on this, matter I need a resolution.  Fiona,…,I was excited for this staycation, but it turns out to be a total disaster ,upon reaching the hotel the rooms that was given to us had a foul odd smell,  hotel beds had disgusting brown stains on it , toilet rubbish wasn’t change from the previous guest, toilet floor had some white stains not sure where is it came from, and their Taxes for this hotels are unreasonable totally do not recommend‼️paid $150+ for nothing!,Disappointed with the rooms. Upon check in  1) sink not clean still have previous guest hairs on the wash basin. 2) toothbrushes was used and not change to a new one. 3) tv channel was all blurred  4) smelly rooms upon walking in 5) towel rack almost falling off,Marco at reception was friendly super efficient and a credit to the hospitality industry in singapore. He checked us in within a few minutes and had us in the room in no time so that we have lots of time to explore the heritage Chinatown and hunt for breakfast.  The lady at housekeeping (sorry didn’t get her name) was also very friendly and In the short time we had in the corridor she was greeting and chatting with many guests a testament to her professionalism over and above her duties.  Overall a great experience and we will certainly be back.,Excellent location..Can explore surrounding of Chinatown with nice food around.Using Singapore rediscovery voucher with free upgrade to premium suite..Worth to stay..The room is very clean..Only bit of noise from outside can b heard during midnite.

Harbour Ville Hotel Hamilton @ Lavender,3.5,24 reviews,#255 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,This is a review of the Deluxe Single room (no window). FYI you need to deposit $100 before you can check in to ur room, it doesn't say it in any booking apps so bring an extra $100 for that. They say it's in case of any damage you might do to the room. When you check out, you will receive back your $100 but if you check out late you won't get the money. I'll start with the pros of the room, the room has a good design and it's a good budget room. The wifi is very good and fast. There are 4 charging ports in the room for those who need them. The bed is very comfortable and soft. Now I'll list some feedback, first of all the room is very small, it's smaller than what the pictures shows. The room I booked has no fridge but also no chair not even a stool. There were also some dust, near the rubbish bin (see pics) so the housekeeping might have missed that. The walls are thin so it can be noisy sometimes so keep that in mind. The shower water isn't hot enough it's kind of lukewarm. The check out time is 11:00 while most hotels are at 12:00, not sure why they do this. I would only recommend staying in this hotel if there is a discount, because for the price you can book other hotels that are better like the hotel right beside this. ,…,It my first time check in to the hotel, and still under renovation at the 1st floor. The room not that big but it fine. What i going say the fridge not clean still have left over soft drinks, in the morning that noise came from 1st floor, due to renovations.,The room is totally noisy, you can hear what people in the other room are talking about. When I stayed there for 2 nights (11-13 Jan) there's a family who book 3 rooms, they stayed up till 4am, and they opened all the doors, shouting, talking, opening/closing the door. When we complain to the receptionist, she said she has informed the noisy guests, but there's no other things that they can do.  I'm pretty sure my bed has bed bugs, cause my legs get all itchy. When I asked to switch to other rooms, they said the other rooms are smaller and that I have to pay extra (what???).  Once you enter the hotel lobby, straightaway you can feel the stale smell. From the old/dusty sofas, carpets, un-washed towels, etc. Also since the aisle is quite cramped, you hardly can walk pass when, there's cleaning lady lorry, and worst is when you try to walk pass, the cleaning lady gave you a stare as if you shouldn't walk through the aisle when she's cleaning (again, what???).  Stay at your own risk!,…,The room looks totally different on the pictures. The premiere king room that I booked is only available directly next to the reception where people pass by the whole day and it’s super noisy. There was nothing written in the booking or on the website, that this category is only available on the ground floor and switching to an upstairs room would be an extra charge.  In my opinion, it’s a no go for a hotel to inform about that after arrival and take an extra charge for moving to another floor!,Harbour Ville Hotel, Hamilton Summary 4.1 Very good 97 reviews Rooms 2.3 Location 5.0 Service 1.0  6.7/10 · 123 reviews Agoda  4/5 · 16 reviews TripAdvisor  6.6/10 · 145 reviews Booking.com  2.9/5 · 36 reviews Expedia.co.th  5.8/10 · 34 reviews Hotels.com Reviews  Search reviews People often mention  Jennie Yan 2/5 just now on  Google Pros: - Friendly service. - Close to the train. - Walking distance to Haji Lane and Arab street.

They brought a plunger but still didn't fix the problem. This happened at 4am because we were jet lagged so house keeping, wasn't able to fix it until later in the day. They did give us temporary access to another room so we could use that bathroom in the meantime.

Sheraton Towers Singapore,4.5,"2,473 reviews",#17 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,We went with our daughter for a 1 night staycation at Sheraton Singapore. We were early and was allow to check in early. They also allowed for late checkout upon request. The front desk staffs were friendly and accommodating.   During our stay, we have a nice surprise from the front desk, special thanks to Ms Madani and staff who brought up the nice tea snacks and 2 refreshing drinks. Really nice of them, appreciate this thoughtful  act of them.   The housekeeping staff was also thoughtful, she has check on us to see if we need additional things in the room.   Overall, a memorable and pleasant stay at Sheraton.,A wonderful experience for a well held wedding dinner at the Sheraton given the covid situation. Very professional and all SDM were adhered during the event.  The staff were all highly attentive to details and ensured a smooth event on that day.  They were able to respond to my last minute requests and delivered without a hitch. I love the Chinese cuisine served on that night especially the fresh fish and teochew yam dessert. In my opinion, one of the best Chinese cuisine you get from a wedding dinner.  Special thanks to Simin, Valerie, Shirley, Chao Xian, Mei Yee, Tommy, Esther, Phyo, Chef Goh, Chef Tan, Chef Eric and many many more whom made this experience possible.,My partner and I booked a staycation from 28th to 30th November.  We arrived at the hotel before 12 and were pleasantly surprised to be checked in within 5 minutes. However upon entering the room we were greeted to a very musky smell that smelled to come from the carpets.  Staying at room 1321, we had a good view of the swimming pool. We also opted for the $50 food and beverage credit which was a good way to order in room dining. PS/ The Wagyu burger was great.  In my opinion the Sheraton was a nice stay, it was within walking distance to Newton MRT and if you feel like a good walk, Orchard is a bout 10 minutes away on foot.  I did however have a tarnishing experience trying to get a taxi on Sunday night as the gentleman on duty (no mentions named) was curt and very unhelpful, , Checking out was a breeze despite it being Monday morning.   Just to let you know the food and beverage credit does not apply to bar snacks and is also non-refundable. I thank everyone at Sheraton for their hospitality.,…,The room wifi is not complimentary, apparently you have to become a member to access wifi. This is unprofessional for a big hotel brand. The reception staff were cold.  Restaurant breakfast was pretty bad. Pool bar is closed. There is practically nothing to do here if you are on a staycation avoid this place.,I got a room on a weekday at a very good rate and checked myself in for some work. Whilst I’m sure this hotel has seen better days pre-COVID, they are doing all they can to maintain standards in the property.   Check-in/out, room service, requests for housekeeping and other amenities are all done via the app, which is pretty much catching up with technology and in accordance with COVID-19 safety measures. That said, everyone in the property still maintained a pleasant disposition.   Some issues to point out of the room (1804): Besides lamps were always at maximum brightness and it’d be really useful to have a dimmer. Same goes for the bathroom.  Wifi and air conditioning were excellent.   My only real gripe with the location of this hotel is that I can’t walk out to grab a snack, because there’s really nothing at all unless I walk abit farther on.   ,…","City View,Business",21284,Sheraton.com,523,78,88

We like to give a big thanks to Haley. We were surprised by her beautiful gestures, lovely welcome, excellent services.  She surprised us with an awesome room which was specially decorated with a birthday theme. The hotel sponsored a bottle of red wine, beverages and snacks.  She helped us to take photos to create memorable memories. She shared with us about the hotel's Valentine's Day and Christmas promotions. That attracted us to stay The Scarlet Hotel  again. It definitely worths the return visits.,We were greeted by Nigel whose efficient and friendly manner made us feel even happier to arrive in Singapore. The following days we were greeted by Nazir. His warm and relaxed manner felt genuine. On our last few days Faizz was very helpful and efficient He managed our booking for an additional night.. All of you guys made it a memorable experience. Thanks again we really appreciate it.  The Scarlet’s location is ideal for the Maxwell food court and buzzing China town. The Scarlet itself is on a quiet street.,This is the 2nd time my husband & I disappeared from the hussel &bustle of parenting & work to reconnect in a hotel made love. A Perfect location, clean rooms, a stocked minibar and a room with a balcony is just right.  The 24 reception is fantastic, and on checking in  Hailey + Faizz went above and beyond with help and friendliness. I highly recommend this venue.,Stayed at The Scarlet Singapore while in Singapore for 7 nights, recently.  Rooms are clean, the front desk is available 24 hours, and the location gives you immediate access to Chinatown and is within walking distance to major tourist areas. The staff, from the time we checked in to the time we checked out, was extremely helpful. Not only did they provide recommendations for adventures, routes to take, cater to our requests quickly, they also help my mother and me navigate the COVID-19-related requirements and testing. I cannot reiterate enough that the staff at the Scarlett Singapore Hotel, especially Nawauri, Faizz, Nazir, and Diana, made our time in Singapore 100X better amidst the peak COVID outbreak.,We checked in on 5th Jan 2022 and checked out on 6th Jan 2022. We were served by a staff name Faizz. We had one of the best customer service we could ever asked for. Faizz was extremely nice and polite, he helped us throughout our stay and made it hassle free.   I would highly Recommend this Hotel for those who are looking to have a nice and private stay with their love ones.","Quaint,Charming",10351,Agoda.com,1055,128,100
Hotel NuVe Urbane,4.0,255 reviews,#117 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,The hotel was constructed within a facade of a building set aside for conservation, so it really does give a very quirky feel.   Rooms were pretty small, slightly larger than the ones in Tokyo, but most importantly, they're pretty clean and well-kept.   Was 'upgraded' to rooms by the poolside, which is a boon or bane actually. If you want to swim, it's great to just walk out of the room and into the pool (with Covid, need to register with front desk first). But it also means a lack of privacy and can be noisy as other guests use the pool.   Location wise, very convenient. If you're up up it, can even walk to Bugis. If not, MRT stations Lavender (East-West line) and Jalan Besar (Downtown line) are just round the corner. Lots of food options around too.   Cosy, but just, functional. Good for a quick getaway. ,…,Im giving this review on behalf of my sister and brother who have book the hotel from 25/10-26/10. The room number is 314.   After a bad experience in another hotel, They decided to Walk - In at Hotel NuVe Urbane Upon Check in, Mr John Martinez (The Hotel Manager)  really made their day with his service! He is very good! They love the way how he serve them upon check in and check out.. They are looking forward to their next stay cation again!,I chose this hotel mainly due to its balcony as I do not want to go out of the hotel much and I want some fresh air. But I was quite disappointed when the balcony is just a narrow strip of walkway which connects to the other rooms and separated just but a small chain.  The walls are also too thin and the traffic noise from the road beside is quite loud till very late into the night. The guests next door were at their balcony and was talking(normal talking volume) and I can clearly hear every word they say in my room.  Other than these 2 personal unhappiness of mine, the location is quite good. It is within walking distance to Little India, a street where many Turkish food and merchandises are found, restaurants, shopping and a metro station.   The room is small, just enough room, for one person to walk a U shape area around the bed. But it is clean.  If you are getting the room with the complimentary mini bar, please note that besides the usual complimentary tea and coffee, the mini bar consists of 2 oreo cookie packs, and 3 soft drinks in the fridge.  For those who just want a bed after some time exploring Singapore and wants some convenience, this hotel would be ok.,…,slow check in, extremely small rooms despite booking the ones with balcony space, staff charged us extra upon check out without even informing us in advance.

It looked promising online, so when I went to Singapore, I just showed up at the hotel and booked what was available. My room could very well be what's in the photo here: King-sized bed, TV, big shower and just enough room for my one-night stay. This is very convenient to the financial district and Chinatown. The best part was the hot-tub on the roof, which you can reserve for one-hour segments at night. It was the perfect remedy for my 17-hour flight from the U.S.,Our room (superior king) was fantastic!  Comfortable bed and clean linen! Other surrounding hotel should stand aside from this astounding new hotel with concept. In overall, my stay was good and the hotel staff is very friendly too!,Location is fantastic. This hotel is only 5 min walk to Clarke Quay MRT. There are lots of cafes and restaurants in the area.

Only 3-min walk from Clarke Quay station and many cafes in the area. Many major attractions within walking distance and staff were really helpful and friendly.   The minibar in the room is totally free! Totally loved this service especially the coffee machine. :)   They offer breakfast at a cafe just opposite the hotel and it was really good and convenient.,Location is strategic, walking distance to the metro and many eateries and restaurants. Check-in by Ally was smooth and prompt, Fish from Frontdesk was also friendly and efficient. Clever room layout for space maximising, sufficient number of power points including USB charging.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location in a very pretty historical district is perfect for a night between flights: the taxi to the airport takes 10minutes max and there are plenty of restaurants and bars around.  Within 15-20min wslking you’ll get to a park by the sea with coffeeshops. The only drawback is that the room had no window but aside from that it was perfect!,I've stayed here with my partner for 12 days. Everything is good for the price range.

Even grocery stores. Peaceful place, we had a relaxing stay. We loved it!,Located just outskirts of Katong area, this former Fragrance Budget hotel just got it's new name to Ibis Budget. Room is decent enough if all you wanted is just sleep after a long day in Singapore.   It's clean & quiet for those unfussy travelers. ,A simple, no-fuss hotel for those on a mid-size budget. Beds were relatively comfy, room was clean and washroom of good size. This hotel has been around for a while but I have only recently stayed here due to it being under Accor Group now.  Did not have breakfast so couldn't comment but there are a lot of cafes around the area. If you desire, you can walk 10mins to the Malay Village area or Haig Road food centre for endless choices of local fare.  It is a little far from the nearest MRT station so a better choice would be to walk to the main street about 2 mins away and catch the bus to another MRT station - the front desk should be able to advise travellers on this. There seemed to be quite a number of tour groups using this hotel so lobby can get a little noisy at times., Surrounding bars at night tend to be a little sleazy but the area is generally safe - just don't go walking around in slinky clothes or stumbling around intoxicated. As a lady, I had no issue walking back to the hotel at night or even having a smoke outside the hotel at midnight.  For those who drive, there are only 2-3 parking lots on a first come first serve basis so depends on your luck whether you get a spot on arrival.

Spacious room, great clean facilities, and super friendly and helpful staff. While serving SHN in this hotel, I called the front desk to ask if they had any regular dairy creamer instead of the non-dairy ones, they immediately bought a new packet full of dairy creams and sent it to my room. I even made sure it was perfectly fine if they didn't have the regular ones, but they even went out of their way to send me a full package of creamer along with a super sweet card.,The hotel and rooms are old (but spacious!), the customer service is great.  Wendy and team were very accommodating to our needs as we had a toddler with us.   The floors aren’t carpeted, which was what we wanted due to allergies. However, when we arrived at the room, I could feel the floor was not clean. The mat I used to clean the floor was all grey and dirty after giving it a wipe.   The skin of my bed was peeling but all that they could do was give us a broom - which was rather handy as we wanted to clean the room often.   We requested for extra pillows to secure my son when he sleeps, and the hotel kindly provided them. Wendy was so nice to get a soft toy for my son which he adores until now.

Ji Hotel Orchard Singapore,4.0,22 reviews,#211 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Ji Hotel staycation exceeded my expectations. The recent reviews about this hotel made me lower my expectations by a lot. Instead, I was met with friendly and helpful staff, and a great and clean room.  We stayed 2 night in the superior room, and we didn't regret booking our staycation here. The only down side was that check-in took a little longer, and due to the small lobby, people behind us had to queue out of the entrance. I could tell that the staff were already trying their best to speed up the process. Do take note that if you leave rubbish outside of your door hoping that house keeping staff will pick them up quickly, it won't be. Our rubbish was left overnight until housekeeping started their rounds in the morning. We met with really great front office staff who helped, my partner tap open the lobby door twice when he went down to collect food. They only gave 1 key card which had to be left in the room for electricity to run. Honestly loving the vibes of the hotel, as the place have a woody interior and is quite specious for a $100/night room. There were enough amenities like bedroom slippers, toothbrush and paste, basic soap, water kettle, and they even gave 2 cans of complimentary drinks for our stay. Location was superb! Very near Dhoby Ghaut MRT and Plaza Sing. There were also a lot of food choices at UBS building (which is only a few steps away). Hopefully the hotel and team will be able to do well with the upkeep of the hotel, and I look forward to go back there again.,…,This budget hotel is quite covenient in terms of location, and cleanliness. The amenities is quite complete. We can do our own laundry and warm our food at the public facility down at the second floor. Since it doesn’t include breakfast, we need to find our own breakfast in the office area next to the hotel, since it has only one small restaurant at the hotel. Some of the staffs are friendly but the others needs improvement in terms of hospitality. When I asked once to get more bottles of water, one of the staffs answered curtly that they were only provide us with 2 bottles of water per day.  If you decided to choose this hotel, don’t expect more in terms of friendly hospitality.,Reasons why it's a good hotel to consider 1) super near vicinity to Dhoby Ghaut station 2) Fort Canning park is just at the back 3) 7-eleven and Killiney Coffee are located at UBS building downstairs ==> convenience 4) Deluxe room is spacious and clean, with essential amenities 5) Body Wash and Shampoo are supposedly infused with essential oil 6) Check-in and Check-out service is fast and receptionists are friendly & helpful  Reason why I was disappointed The air con panel showed 21 degrees C, but the room was quite warm. We tried to set the temperature lower but the room was not getting cooler. We thought the air con might take a while to cool down, but after after 3 hours (at midnight), we couldn't endure anymore. A call to the front desk revealed that our air con was set to, ""Fan Mode"". We tried dabbling with the air con panel but didn't know how to set it to AC mode. A staff was dispatched to help us, and he really gave us ""attitude"". Stormed into the room, pressed a few buttons on the air con panel, and left! He didn't even answer us when we asked him how to set to AC mode. We must have disturbed his beauty sleep.  This experience really marred all the 5-star aspects of the hotel :(,…,This is a ""forced"" staycation as we had to use the ReDiscover vouchers.  To be honest, I didnt expect much but I do my research on hotels that is close to the $100 range as my main motive is to use finish the vouchers.  To be honest, the hotel room is not bad for the price paid, however let me list out the bad before listing out the good.  The Bad: 1) Hotel front desk is not very responsive, I ring up the front desk from my room; 4 times, each time for a good 1 minutes plus and no one pick up. I had to call the hotel main line using my mobile phone and magically, the front desk pick up within just 5 seconds.   On one occasion, after speaking on the phone on my request, the front desk just hang up the call without saying a courtesy good bye or acknowledgement.  2) The house, keeper is not very fast in her work, requested for a shower gel and it took her 25mins to get me the item.  3) There are tiny ants crawling on the table in my room, I had to be pest buster for the night occasionally.  4) No bedroom slippers  5) The fabric headboard of the bed smells  6) The window is not very soundproof, my room is located right above the main entrance of the hotel and lower level, I can hear people talking right below, and these people are usually the smokers.  7) People can just smoke right next to the entrance of the hotel door, and I witness even the hotel staffs are doing it  8) Gym is closed due to Covid situation  9) In the evening time, you are on your own for house keeping, the staffs all went back home  10) No in house parking, had to park opposite  The Good 1) Big TV, 65 inch with alot of Cable TV Channels  2) Japanese Zen feel to the shower   3) Very good toilet amenities  4) The quality of the furnishing is really above average.  Overall, I would still wana come and stay at this hotel due to factors such as price and proximity location to Orchard.,…,Booked a superior room and paid for the upgrade to the Deluxe Room. Big mistake for me.  Called a day before arrival to check with them if the Deluxe Room had a table and chair for us to setup a laptop as my partner still had work to do. I was informed ""Yes there is"". Delighted, I happily hung up the phone.   Fast forward to post check-in. We paid for the $20/Night Upgrade (which seemed like a good deal) went up to the room and to my surprise, I saw a sofa and no table nor chair. There was however a square bedside table not in proximity to the sofa to do any work.   Only option then was to pull out the bedside table to the sofa.  Check-In Process was longer than I expected, being a hotelier myself I have never asked all checking-in guests to sign in on reg card each. (Curious, Process)  Overall the hotel was alright, lacks any human touch if thats the kind of getaway you are looking for. Plenty of food across the road at Plaza Singapura, and theres a 7/11 at the UBS building next door. Its about 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel.   Experience for the weekend was alright, rooms are nice and clean. But still room for improvement.   Do note that the standard Check-Out time is 1100 Hours. (11am),…",,8391,Booking.com,176,46,100

Check in was quick. Slow elevators transport guests to rooms on 9 floors. Rooms are small but very clean. Quiet air conditioner keeps room cool. Bathroom with decent shower and hot water. Clean sheets. Bed was a little hard but not bad. Small television with poor reception. Window has view of a back alley.  Noise from the hallway can be slightly disturbing especially the sound of the elevator bell as it travels between floors and echoes down the hall. Neighborhood is a red light district in the evening but is still very safe to walk through. MRT station is 10 minute walk. No restaurant in the hotel but a few noodle shops nearby.  If my future travel required, only a shower, sleep and short turnaround in Singapore I would stay here again. Give the taxi driver the address of the hotel - there are several hotels in the neighborhood with similar names and drivers might get confused. ,…,Booked online for 2 nights while I was working on getting a visa done in Singapore. Didn't check out the area as I was looking for something close to the Embassy on Orchard Rd. Hotel facade is good, tiny lobby, and has 2 functional roomy elevators. Because of it's location I think you can get the rooms for ""short time"", as I went down to th lobby to get some help with my wireless connection and a young guy and lass were booking a room, had no bags, and she had quite a bit of make-up, short skirt, and hi heeels (lol).  Anyway, the rooms are real basic, hsower is pretty good though, and the towels are functional. A/C worked good but the tv was bad. Bed was firm, but comfy and didn't get bitten or see any bugs either (that is a plus). Sheets (clean) and skimpy blanket are, sufficient but are not designed to keep you warm.  Overall i would say it is ok for the seasoned traveller on a budget. There is a hint of being on the ""seedy side"" and all that brings with it (security concerns, drunks, working ladies etc), but keep your wits about you and you will have a good time. Plenty of cheap food options, drinks, and tables to sit at and watch the world go by. And you never know, but maybe a working gal will sit down at your table and have a chat with you about life as you enjoy your curry and beer :),…,Clean, small rooms. staff is honest, we forgot laptop in our room and they returned it ti us.  Interesting location - center Red light town, but it was safe in hotel and wasn't noisy. It is near metro station - is a plus. A lot of food places are near hotel,This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, as we arrived there were men in the lobby asking for 2 hour rooms.  I did know that this was in the red light district but didnt realised it would be used as part of it! When we went in to our room we could hear loud slaps and moaning coming from one of the rooms on our floor! A bit off putting!  The room was basic and blankets were a bit gross.  Virbrant area with lots of places to eat nearby however...","Mid-range,Modern",4617,ZenHotels.com,63,6,71
"Holiday Inn Express Singapore Serangoon, an IHG hotel",4.5,62 reviews,#148 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid private parking on-site,English,"Share, ,The People at the Front desk the day I checked in were a blessing. MY reservation date was wrong but they accepted the rate I booked under. I was so grateful for that. The hotel room was nice and new. The location is on a main street so getting around was super easy. I used grab while there but you can walk to many spots to eat. Singapore was our first stop in our Southeast Asia trip... The breakfast was your standard buffet.,The neighborhood of Jelan Besar is quite a wonderful treat for us. This hotel is conveniently located besides The bus station and MRT. Going places was a breeze. Check in was efficient and fast. It’s an express hotel so get used to fetching things yourself. No issues for us there as the staffs are helpful. Breakfast was quite good. The essentials are there proportionate to the rate you pay. Several malls within area plus lot’s of dining choices in every nook and cranny.,I highly recommend this property. Courteous and friendly staff are waiting with a big smile to welcome y’all. Kudos to Ingrid, Mandy, Terry, Jerran. Christina. Mr. Michael and Sheryl who smoothly checked me in. Hotel has variety of good breakfast choices not congested at all. To mention this property you’ll see what team works really means the kitchen staff, head chef and Hotel Manager are helping each other to attend the guests particularly during the breakfast and during guests queue. ,Not a great start when the taxi driver at the airport had never heard of the hotel.  Check in when we eventually found the place was very quick and the staff VERY helpful in every way.  Our room was very small but very clean and modern. The beds and linen were really comfy but the pillows were WAY too soft for me, even the ones they called firm. The shower was lovely, no complaints there. Most hotels supply an electrical adaptor but they couldn't seem to find an Australian one so we had to walk down the road on our first night to buy our own adaptor just to charge our phones which was a bit of a let down for me. This hotel does not exchange currency and the closest money changer was quite a walk or taxi ride away at Mustafa Centre, very inconvenient!  The housekeeping made up, our room every day, much appreciated. The breakfast was something to eat, with minimal choice, nothing to rave over but sufficient.  There is a bus stop right out front which makes it very difficult to get a taxi as they don't like stopping out the front as it's illegal in the bus lane.  The closest MRT was a bit of a walk when you are tired which was a real game changer for me.  I did enjoy my stay and the staff went above and beyond but I would prefer to be closer to the city next time as I found this hotel a little too far out of the way.,…,Newly opened hotel, still fresh.  This was a great location with 3 metro stations within walking distance and a bus stop right outside the hotel.  Breakfast available every morning a good selection.  Staff really amazing and helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them.  Great cleanliness. Little India is very close-by, lots of shopping and eating places nearby.  We had an amazing time in Singapore and would definitely return and stay here again.","Family,Centrally Located",,,327,22,97

Fantastic views from the room. The staff were excellent all the way down to housekeeping. Special call out to my attendant who topped up kids drinks in our mini bar when he saw our horde of munchkins.  View from Pool was incredible as was all the food there in general. I would point out to any one trying to stay there over peak periods to book early. This includes dining reservations. Up to a week prior to my stay, all restaurants were already booked out - totally my own fault for not thinking further ahead. On the upside, the room service is incredible and serves pretty much 24 hrs.  Would come back for sure.,Top tip: book slots for the pool early!   Excellent 3 days 2 nights staycation. We were lucky to have a room on the high floors and view was amazing. Check-in and out we're a breeze. Service staff from the front desk, housekeeping and general staff were friendly and polite. Wifi was free and worked well.  Loved that the mini bar was refilled daily, soft drinks, chips, nuts, water and tea replenished 😊  Aircon worked well and beds were comfy. My only gripe was that the shower head was fixed and there wasn't a rain shower. ,Had one night stay with my family GREAT , AMAZING VIEWS from our rooms Luckily we were allocated on 40th floor. But otherwise, breakfast choices were limited - especially for vegetarians Staff service quality was good, but i understand its holiday season - lots of families were having staycation at same time Sadly unable to book for infinity pool Hopefully they will send us email to book for gym/infinity pool like 2 days earlier, so we can book earlier too  Managed to take some photos - posted on my instagram : ig - @naughtynareshy,My son really love the infinity pooh on top of the hotel the lifeguard was very helpful ""thank you Kelvin :) "" ! I love the in room breakfast on bed ! The bed is very comfortable to sleep in the bathroom is huge with bathtub !,The Premium Guest services were excellent, top notch attentiveness from Dyana and Jerry from check-in, explanation, help with swimming pool booking till check-out.   It has been the most memorable staycation for my daughter, also a great place for our advance wedding anniversary celebration.  They have fabulous food from Club55, Spago, Rise, Renku and in-room dining.   Every detail is just so well thought of, staff are customer oriented. I am very impressed and will definitely return to stay if I’m back in Singapore. Even the lifeguard Ryan was so proactive to help us take family photos.   If there is a slight improvement needed, it would be Stella from the infinity pool service team, she could have been more polite to ask and check with her other colleagues instead of brushing, us aside when we said we did not receive the QR code for the swimming pool booking.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,4.5,"2,724 reviews",#22 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese","Share, ,It is very modern, over-designed.  The result is that some of the basics that you expect from a hotel are lacking - particularly in the rooms. I am normally perfectly capable of working out how the lights, blinds, TV etc in a hotel room works, even in a high tech hotel. However, here I was driven mad trying to get things to work and at one point just had to pull all the plugs out of the walls to switch things off at 2am.  Also, there is no hard copy hotel directory, and so if you want to find out things about the hotel, or look up the room service menu you have to do it via the TV screen which is incredibly painful and poorly designed.  All I wanted to do was order a beer.  After 15 minutes of flicking through endless badly designed and slowly loading pages I gave up.    The, rooms are very small.  The design is undoubtedly very cool, but comfort and ease of use takes second place to style.  Bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put your toiletries etc.   Strange Japanese style loos with remote controls  (????).   Small rooftop pool, although is not actually on the top of the hotel, and so has another floor above it and so you won't get any sun.  Everything annoyed me so much I would not return.,…,I have visit many Marriott and jw Marriott hotels across Asia and was looking forward to seeing this one as new . Omg was I disappointed. Upon checking in had a long wait when eventually seen to got 'upgraded' as gold member . Got up to room and was put next to the Elevator which is crazy . I then asked to change room again . Once in new room was disappointed yet again as very small . The room also is cluttered with aluminum furniture which is a hazard banging into . The bathroom was nice. I could not be bothered to change again and fail to see any upgrade in this room ??  I then ventured to the exec lounge where I was 'told' in a rude way that I was not allowed in with slippers . I was gobsmacked . I had very smart  flip flops and general attire . I then went back to my room, and changed into shoes. I was very angry when i got back to the lounge to discover : lots of other people also had open toe attire on and where not informed to leave , I was not told about this on check in. I was also told in a very stuck up and bad way. I have never had this policy in any lounge anywhere in the world . The lounge was very stuffy , and the furniture was not at all relaxing . Again all steel. Very strange set up . The hotel is new and a lot of the staff are very you and not trained properly. The hotel is very badly designed , laid out , stuffy and pretentious. This is the worst hotel I have ever visited in the Marriott group and quite honesty can't wait to leave . The only positive was the great concierge staff. In particular Gary was very attentive and helpful .  A massive thumbs down and will not stay here again . Reflects badly on the Marriott brand .,…,I stayed here on 31 December 2016 as it was a new hotel and was planning to invite some close friends over for a mini countdown party starting at 6pm.   However, when I officially checked in at 6pm, I was shocked to see that the suite I was offered was less than half the size of the one I had booked on booking.com!   Booking.com had stated on its website that the suite I had booked was supposed to be 248 square metres but the suite that I was given was only about 1000 square metres and I called the reception to ask about the huge difference in size. All they could offer in terms of explanation was that it was booking.com's mistake and no compensation was offered whatsoever. I tried to ask for a room upgrade but was told it that the 248 square metres was meant to be a chairman, suite which was unavailable.   Anyway I ordered ice when I went into the lift at 6pm and by 640pm nothing had arrived in the room and I had to give reception another call. At 7.10pm still no ice arrived so I left it to my assistant to handle the matter. She told me that she had to get it herself as the hotel was understaffed. Again I asked her to get some more ice as we were supposed to chill six bottles of alcohol before all my guests arrived. The second round of ice took another hour to arrive. She called for a third round of ice subsequently and was told that there were not enough ice buckets to go around and only one out of the three buckets we called for arrived. I was lucky that I had the foresight to ask a close friend to buy some ice from the nearby 7-11. Otherwise it would have been a disaster.   Overall the hotel is still new and has just changed management so I could overlook the fact that they were understaffed since it was New Year's Eve but the fact about the size of the hotel suite being half of what was stated is practically a breach of contract. I hope that the hotel can clarify this with Booking.com and rectify the matter as soon as possible as it is not the first time this has happened according to the front desk when I tried complaining to them. ,…,We booked a weekend staycation at JW Marriott Hotel South Beach. We were surprised and amazed when the hotel offered to upgrade our deluxe room to a premier suite! Staff service was excellent while food at the hotel was simply wonderful. Thanks for giving us such great experience, we had a great time indeed!,I stayed there for 2 nights and everything was impeccable. The hotel was beside Esplanade metro station and easy to reach by public transportation. Its lobby was artistic and creative that I was much impressed with the candle-lit decoration hanging from the ceiling, not to mention its fashionable furniture and aesthetic ornaments along the hallway. My room was also spacious and trendy, with large french window to capture city view, and my neat and bright bathroom was well-equipped with separate bathtub and shower space. There were also a large gym and a rooftop swimming pool in the hotel, but I had a tight schedule in Singapore and had no time to enjoy them. Everything there was amazing and I will stay there too next time I visit Lion City.","Trendy,City View",23264,Booking.com,691,73,100
ibis budget Singapore Ruby,3.5,957 reviews,#154 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,English,"Share, ,Stayed with my family while on vacation in Singapore. Hotel was nice. Good location and accommodating staffs. Rooms are nice and clean. We enjoyed our stay here while were on Singapore. I hoope to come back soon after the pamdemic.,Our family needed two rooms. One was GREAT, the other decidedly was NOT, hence my 3* rating. The room my husband and I occupied was tiny, but very clean. We slept well. We were grateful that there was a luggage rack, since our previous hotel had nowhere except the bed to put out luggage on.  But just down the hall, as soon as you entered our daughter's room, there was a faint smell of sewage from the bathroom. And between the bottom sheet and the mattress was hair, thick inexplicable black hair which was ""leaking"" out from under the sheet. She pulled out handfuls of what should have been vacuumed or cleaned away before she arrived, causing us to question whether the sheets had actually been changed since the previous tenant. This was surprising to us because Singapore is very, CLEAN. What maid would leave that? I also need to comment that the photos on this site must be of the more expensive rooms. Ours barely had room to move around. I am not complaining about that. Our previous experience with budget hotels was the same. It's just what you get in Singapore if you don't pay top dollar. But I don't want anyone to be deceived by those pictures! We also appreciated that (unlike another hotel where we stayed) there was a small lounge in the lobby where one could sit and read or drink a cup of coffee. With the rooms being so small, the only place to relax is on the bed. The location is great with lots of eateries nearby (local ones, not fast food franchises) and the walk to the metro stop is short. Geylang is the legal red light district of Singapore, but it also has the cheapest hotels. We've never seen anything inappropriate, nor has my husband ever been solicited there,…,Ok this was my second time staying in Geylang area when in Singapore. Geylang is notorious for their red light district area but we don't really mind. In facts, me and my friend got a peaceful and quite stay in this hotel.  We know the hotel is still in major renovation to make their facility better. From Fragrance Ruby Hotel to Ibis Budget Singapore Ruby so Accor took it under their wing. Expect the construction noise but we really didn't get any bother. We know the construction will be on during daytime but we were not in the hotel and at night, we had a peaceful sleep.  The location is not too far from MRT Aljunied if you wanted to walk around maybe 10-12 minutes but you can take a bus from MRT Aljuneid to nearby bus stop, it's only 1-stop just check your google map for, direction and bus number you should take.  Lobby is small but looks modern and clean, the elevator floor is dirty with dust and it's understandable because of the construction workers.   Our room is small but comfy, clean, simple, and served as it purpose. The wi-fi was pretty fast. Air conditioner is really cool, heater worked fine, and it seems the bedding, wallpaper, electric outlet, and any other amenities and furniture just got major renovation as well. Good job!!!  Overall we're satisfied, quite surrounding but offers affordable eateries and convenient stores, strategic with bus stop options in the south and north, and good job.,…,I stay here for 2 nights, small room but nice, clean and comfy, but if you bring a big luggage or you bring so many stuff, it won't suit you unless it's ok for you with a small room and stuff No cupboard to place stuff, but there is wall hanger and folding rack You can hear sounds from outside  Hot water, condiments, hairdryer is great,Our experiences on this hotel did not meet my expectations. Though we were informed that the hotel is under renovations but a lot of  inconveniences you will experience. Workers are using the guest elevators, construction noise is unbearable and the hotel floor lobby is messy with debris , guest's carpet elevator are full of debris and stains.

The room was very clean and the view was nice. One small thing was that we could hear doors slamming quite loudly when people were exiting their rooms, especially at 7am,which I believe they were going for breakfast. The breakfast was simple, although it would be better if they hadore selections. There was a staff who was really really helpful, we were trying to find our way to Plaza Singapura and she directed us to this short cut that really helped to save time and save us from the heat! So thankful, although we didn't get her name. ,Stayed in a deluxe room with city view over a fri night. Highly recommended for those looking for a weekend retreat. View from bathroom is as amazing as marketing photos.   Did not leave the hotel compound and had meals at Salon. Had drinks as well, great vibes with fairy lights at night. Generally decent food. They did appear slightly understaffed but was acceptable.   Hot tips: - ask for your Citibank credit card promo at salon, very value for money   - one for one drinks deal from 4 to 8pm - request for higher floor room ,Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Room is very cosy and we got a pretty decent view, so no issues staying indoors 90% of the time (because it was during phase 2 heightened alert). In room dining is pretty good!

Excellent location and many of the city sights are within walking distance, such as arts gallery and main shopping belt. The closest mrt is Clarke Quay station.

Housekeeping was ok but if you look under beds, you will see a thick layer of dust. ,Hi.   I was there for 1 night. It is 1 too many. Though the price was right, the offer is just not worth it. The saying is fully realised here: You get what you pay for.  The room itself was bigger than many in Singapore. That is a plus. The place did look neat and clean until I opened the refrigerator. Then old hit. I am sensitive to Mold. But think that all should be as well. Choose your poison.  It was everywhere in the fridge. Hence I would not use it and strongly discourage it.  Many may just move on. I Cannot decide for you. Be careful is my advice.  A comment to staff receptionist was met with apathy.  In the end, I suggest another place.  Cheers,Check in was fuss-free and room is relatively spacious compared to similar category hotels. This can be a nice place for a staycation - there's Clarke Quay and Chinatown Point within walking distance; plenty of food options; small rooftop pool.  A good idea will be placing disinfecting wipes in the room and use better towels. The towels in my room were thin and not too pleasing to the eye. My toilet floor was also full of stains.

Thank you for the friendliness and hospitality.,…,My partner booked a Deluxe Queen room for my birthday. However, once entering the room, the room was small and dimly lit so we thought the lights were not turned on completely. We tried turning on all the lights and open the curtains but minimal sunlight could enter the room as it was facing the wall. We also noticed that the aircon vent in the room was coming off and the ceiling towards toilet area was mouldy. We called immediately to inform the service staff and requested for a change of room or an upgrade that we were willing to pay for. However, there were no rooms available as 2 of the rooms that were empty were under maintenance due to leaking ceiling that they couldn't get it fix. We had no choice but to stay in that room for the night. Upon checking out , we wrote in to, the management to feedback on this situation and that such room quality should not be acceptable in a 4-star hotel. However, they say the mouldy ceiling was ""inevitable and that they are only responsible for linens, toilets and floors"" .

The rooms, building and environs are superlative. All facilities in our room were controlled by iPads in bedroom and lounge. The Courtyard suite was really amazing. We stayed here also in 2013, since then there have been some changes but the atmosphere and heritage remains.  The staff were very well drilled and delivered their services immaculately. The staff on the Courtyard bar were a little more relaxed and easy to chat to. Swimming pool area was quiet staff there were very welcoming and friendly.,From the moment that we were greeted with ‘Welcome home’ on arrival until the moment we left when the team waved us off, we very much felt like we were part of the Raffles family.  We’ve now stayed at Raffles quite a few times on  staycations and it never gets tired or old - there is always something new to discover and new ways for the hotel and teams that work there to surprise you.   This time we stayed for my birthday and fair to say that Raffles pushed the boat out with champagne in the room and an unbelievable gift  that literally brought tears to my eyes.  As always - butler service was exemplary (thanks Grace and team), rooms were immaculate, Writers Bar welcoming and a great spot to spend a few hours, and food delicious!  Long may we be able to stay at ‘home’! ,Currently here at the hotel for a short stay. From the moment we arrived at Changi airport and were met and escorted to our (very comfortable) car we have experienced tremendous service. The hotel itself is absolutely breathtaking in its design, architecture and decoration. We had previously visited pre-restoration and can say that the essence of the hotel has not changed but has been brought up to date by the addition of technology and sympathetic restoration. The suite we have is spacious and equipped well with all amenities. The furnishings are exceptional from the furniture in the parlour, the spacious and very comfortable bed to the roll top bath in the double vanity bathroom.   Today we were treated to the History of Raffles tour by Mr. Roslee, who not only was extremely, knowledgeable but regaled us with some anecdotes and kept us entertained for the hour of the tour. Well worth booking for hotel guests. All the staff we have met have been extremely friendly, efficient and helpful and I cannot fault a single one of them.  The covid19  safety measures are in place and being adhered to - including having to book in advance for meals (not breakfast) to ensure social distancing. When we arrived we had to isolate until the results of our PCR test were through. Breakfast was delivered to our room in a safe manner.

Our compliments to all the staff, management, architects, interior designers and builders on a magnificent job done on the hotel. We cannot fault the staff of the hotel who interacted with us from the famed Raffles doormen, valet, wait staff, butlers to housekeeping.

Frequent power outages are another feature.,For relax sleeping at central chinatown, this pods is really silent and clean, practice, include bfast and bath towel, free flow mineral water, double pod top bittom Minimal noisy, rain shower warm water, egg n bread n coco crunch bfast, worth for stay , value is 8/10, use MRT chinatown n exit to mosque street,Clean and well kept. Have drinking water refill. Toilet is clean. Had a good sleep. Check in and check out is smooth. Breakfast self service is not bad. Overall good experience if just for 1-2 nights. Sound proofing not so good when upper guest comes in the whole bed shake and have shaking sound. ,Our first time in a pod and booked if after considering many options in expensive Singapore.   Firstly the late night check in was very smooth. It took only 5 min.  The pod we booked was a double pod and was surely enough for two. It was nice and clean with good ventilation , tv , usb ports and lights. WIFI speed was satisfactory as well.  There is a small fridge , hot water machine , biscuits, coffee and tea packs placed in every dormitory room.   Bathrooms were clean enough to use. After all it was shared by few others so it all depends on the user.   Breakfast given is very very basic but we really did enjoy. Good place to make friends from people from other parts of the world.   Staff was friendly and supportive.  We really enjoyed the two night stay here as its a different, experience and would recommend to all.    ,…,We recently spent 1 night in the Galaxy Pods @ Chinatown.  The pod itself was ok in size for a nights sleep although you do here noise coming from the other pods such as people snoring.  There is water available and shower facilities with clean towels supplied.  Breakfast was included but we decided to eat at a local Hawker Centre.  Galaxy Pods is conveniently located to Chinatown and loads of street food in the surrounding neighbourhood.  We would stay here again for a stopover of max 1 night again.",,,,869,127,100
Mandarin Orchard Singapore,4.0,"12,694 reviews",#89 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,Booked the Deluxe Superior for five days and given a room that was right behind Cineleisure’s aircon condensers. I was rather perplexed by the need to allocate that room as it was noisy continually, with the back of Cineleisure for a view and was the first room out of the lift. However, after realising that the noise was not going to stop and I needed a quiet room for meetings, I requested for a room change and was upgraded to a Deluxe room with no questions asked. The service recovery was great, but I thought the issues could have been pre-emptied in the first place as it was a relatively long stay. Overall, meals that Chatterbox was great! The waitresses were very attentive and caring, especially when our two kids were there. Housekeeping was also great - the chambermaid on, 32nd floor was very flexible and often waited for us to go for lunch before cleaning our room. Would certainly consider going back again in future.,…,Overall, it was an enjoyable stay and liked the location and service. I was upgraded to a club level room but as my wife and I enter the room, there was an old carpet smell that is typical for older hotels/ carpet. I have smelled this before in other hotels. The room itself was nice, and liked the bathroom which had a nice touch with four body spray shower heads; however, the water pressure was too low for these shower heads to be enjoyable. Also, there was no real hot water from the shower as it was just above lukewarm no matter the time of day when we took showers. Outside of this, the breakfast was a nice value, and the staff were very friendly and very helpful and the location was very convenient to many places my wife and I visited around the area. I would give my overall, rating as a 3.75/5. ,…,Everything was good, staff was friendly! We checked in at 9am and left at 6pm. Food from the menu was 50% off which made it worth it. Bathroom bathtub was a bit dirty but easily cleaned away using the shower ,room is spacious and clean, bed is comfortable. Location is at the heart of Orchard Road, you can use the big umbrella from the room if it is raining heavily outside. Drawbacks are swimming pool only allowed 6 people, so unlikely to book for usage, gym doesn't provide drinking water.,+ Promotional price + Location: Smacked between Orchard and Somerset + Despite hotel renovations, there is no noticeable renovation noise in the room.  + Birthday cake! Nice and chocolatey.  + Bathtub  + Good sized TV  - Stuffy lobby (aircon not on due to renovations) and seemingly long queue during checkin  - Aircon temperature adjustment in room not responsive, had to off aircon occasionally if gets too cold, and on back for ventilation. Not many other rooms to change to since part of the hotel is under renovations.  Overall still a good value given the promotional price. ","Centrally Located,Family",12633,Booking.com,524,86,100
Mercure Singapore On Stevens,4.0,457 reviews,#104 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Secured parking,"English, French, Chinese, Filipino","Share, ,I know this hotel is new, but it was an absolute disaster from check in to check out.  The worst offense of the hotel cannot be changed, the size of the hallway and rooms.  I just realized, this is basically a private hostel.  My first time in a hostel, hoorah!  If you happen to have two suitcases, you cannot wheel them down the hallway to your room, because the hallway is not wide enough!. (see pics)  This alone shows an absolute lack of basic human decency towards guests to save money in design construction.  This may sound odd, but ignore book and you'll see.  The rooms are ummm. Hmm, they can fit a bed, table, hard as rock cheap chair and thats about it.  The bed was comfortable at least, but no heat and it was cold.  The bathroom was small but ok. A very high (cheap) toilet, that is not good for your ummm, #2's medically speaking.  I felt boxed in as a solo traveler.  NO WAY could one room accommodate a couple.  IF you have kids LOL, where where would they sleep, not even room on the floor.  No place to put a cot if you have a baby and all the supplies that go with that.  Yes, that small (see pics)  The room interior is nice enough and the high ceilings help as much as they can.  Nice big TV and they will dismount it for you to plug in your HDMI cable (call downstairs)  Laundry is available at 8SGD for wash (liquid already in machine) and 8SGD drying.  Gym seemed popular, restaurant looked ok, but overpriced and a very very very odd menu.  Hopefully in time the hotel's soft product will improve, but as of now, most of the hotel staff are beyond clueless.  There are some odd standouts that try and are very aware of the situation.  If you care little about clueless staff and tiny rooms, then you'll be ok.  Location is in a very beautiful neighbourhood, but not near anything of note.  Ubers and Taxi's work.  There is a shuttle bus, but it drops you off at a hideous Duty Free mall, filled with the worst type of tourists that you have to wade through.  I will not return to this hotel.  It was a last minute booking and had little to choose from.    About a 30-40 min drive from the hotel via Uber or Taxi.  You can subway it from Changi and then either walk or taxi from the station.  If up for it, you could Subway it with transfer to the Duty Free mall and take the free bus (hassle but big money saver).  I'd say the soft product should improve by April/May 2018.  The rooms will not!  Do not pay over $80 USD for this private dorm hostel!   Horrible.,…,Stayed here for a night during a stop over. Service was good and the staff were professional  and accommodating.   The room and the shower is small; really small when compared to the one in Roxy. There is no wardrobe, instead a small open air partition is available on top of the mini fridge. The bed here was comfortable and air conditioning was good.  The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service.,The executive lounge is a highlight of this hotel, both service and food are excellent. Happy hour daily from 6-8pm, wide range of food / snacks, and the best thing is they change the food offering everyday so guest that have longer stay wont get bored with the happy hour.  The service provided by the lounge manager Mira Sulaiman was beyond expectation and incredibly detail to attention, she assisted us in reservation and room arrangement prior to our arrival to ensure we all enjoy a smooth and pleasant stay. This level of service is the reason why i choose to stay here my every visit to Singapore.,Experience from 3 weeks stays. The hotel looks big, classy and grand from the outside. But hotel rooms are very tiny. If you've plan to stay for more than 3 nights, better look for other choices. Or upgrade to bigger room options. Swimming pool looks nice, but in fact dirty. Not well cleaned with moldy tiles. After swim, body will get itchy.   Location:  Not located in Orchard center but near by and free shuttle service provided. This is a good service. Public bus from Orchard cost only 0.83¢. Only 15 min of walking distance from Hotel to Shaw center.  Reception:  Depends on your luck. Some friendly with big smile, but some poor attitude.   Cleanliness:  This must be improve! Cleanliness is very important for a hotel.  Cleaners' attitude is very poor. They just simply do their, job, rush cleaning due to many guests in & out. And they carried mobile phone during work. Example, They don't mop the floor. They didn't vacuumed well the corners in the room. At times, they forgot to replace the toilet floor mat.  Toilet flooring and tiles covered with water stain (yellowish).  The worst thing is cleaner use face tower to clean the basin/ toilet bowl! (Proof that some video posted online are true.)  Better training must provided, and quality control must be done extra regularly.  In Europe, some 4-star hotel will have final quality check by the management.   The condition of the hotel/rooms will get worse because of the poor maintenance.  Management please improve and provide training. Training is a must and most important in regards to service attitude and cleanliness.,…,Stay for 7 days and this was a great hotel, good friendly staff, awesome pools and very well equipped gym onsite. The restaurant had super breakfast options and the staff was supper helpful for special order.",,,,19,3,85
ST Signature Jalan Besar,4.5,34 reviews,#72 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),Chinese,"Share, ,Visited twice for cheap, fun, getaways with friends. Upper cabin rooms with bathroom attached for both times.  Rooms: 4/5. Loft concept, even though they are small, they dont feel too squeezy. Worth taking note that rooms without window have no ventilation at all so they feel cold and damp. Windowed rooms are fine. The toilet may have an unplesant smell at times but only encountered once. The aircon was okay during both times I visited; (not sure why some ppl complaint about ac not being strong enough). The bed area may not be as cold as other areas for upper cabin rooms but it's managable.  Service: 5/5 So far, no problem. Easy to check in through app. No unnecessary human interaction required; perfect for genZs. Chat service as well as the hotline is available afterhours., Cleaning service can be requested and it can even be asap if the maids are available.   Location: 5/5 Just across the mrt station. Many cheap food spots as well as cafes to explore in the nearby area. There's a thai mini mart and an indian shop downstairs for snacks and drinks.   Overall, definitely a place we will come back. Worth paying the price.,…,Here to document an unusual disappointing experience i had last night at ST JB. i have multiple enjoyable short stays at ST JB previously but had an disappointing one last night. was watching TV on bed waiting for 10pm checkout time, at 9.15pm i heard someone was keying the unlocking code to my room door. Moments later the door opened but luckily i have latched it thus it could not be opened fully. I shouted and the door was closed again. Couples of mins later, hotel staff came knocking at my door to verify my booking that confirmed was 5-10pm. Got to know from her that it was other guest came to unlock my door and surprised to see it was still occupied. Hotel staff took down my name and screen shot my booking confirmation, apologise and left, leaving me wondering how can this, be happening.   I hope the Hotel can provide an explanation to this blunder. Other than the unusual disappointing experience last night, i would still recommend ST signature jalan besar for those searching for affordable short stays as the hotel is just situated besides MRT station with many choices for food within walking distance.,…,I stayed here for 6 nights. The Aircon was freezing cold. Even when I put at 30 Deg!! The walls are so thin . I can almost everything from next door unit. The toilet glass door so hard to really close or get into. Such a terrible place. Don't go!!,I chose to have a staycation here as it seems as tho it has a really nice simplicity feels in it! When i arrived, it was one of the best stays in a place before! Customer service/Staff was amazing, they offered me a pair of slides as they saw me walking out without shoes and they even offered me a solution and resolved my WiFi issue! Excellent, will definitely drop by again in the future!,Due to delays brought about by the current pandemic, I had the opportunity to stay here for a couple of months and I gotta say it is one of the best experiences so far!  The rooms are spacious and charmingly designed and there are basic amenities for daily necessities. The location is also incredibly convenient, with numerous good local cuisines within minutes or walking and public transport to almost anywhere within the main island. The staff were also incredibly helpful and responsive to any of my queries and request.  Be it a short staycation or a slightly longer term  (indefinite) stay like my situation, I'd definitely recommend ST Signature Jalan Besar to anyone!",,6745,Agoda.com,293,47,100
Hotel 81 Orchid,3.0,546 reviews,#207 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Malay","Share, ,The Hotel 81 chain has a dubious reputation and most people know why. I have stayed in this particular Hotel 81 a number of times in transit inbetween flights. Although it always seems I'm one of the few ""real"" guests there I find the rooms always very clean, the staff friendly and the location convenient. I have stayed in 5 star hotels which were 4 times as expensive, but much worse than Hotel 81. A big thumbs up! ,The hotel's street frontage caters for Singapore's red light district.   I had discovered the hotel online and of course there was no way of knowing that it was the ""meeting point"" for that industry.  I took my wife there and was very embarrassed for her.  ,i stay in hotel 81 orchid. many times.before is OK. but this time hotel really terrible. staff so friendly in check-in time.after check-in they care nothing. i leave key for make up room. when i arrive to room. in room still have long hairs on the floor. in bathroom even they don't have hand soap. windows never open. room smell dust and humidity. in check-out. you just leave key in lobby and leave the hotel. no check. even staff don't said. thank you. front to hotel have a lot of 1 night stand girl. people take to hotel. and in hotel you can hear girls sound every night to morning. from your next door. that's terrible. because hotel lobby cannot do nothing for this people. they just want sell the room for short time stay,Before selecting this hotel you should understand two things – 1) Hotels in general are very expensive in Singapore. 2) This is a budget hotel in an expensive city. A common mistake we often make is to expect things which a budget hotel is supposed to provide and forget the fact that we have opted the hotel simply because we couldn’t have afforded another hotel which could have provided the luxuries we are looking for.  The nearest MRT station is Kallang which is about 850 mtr from the hotel and a 10 min walk. I simply followed the google map and walked to hotel from Kallang MRT without asking for direction. The reception staff was helpful and the check-in was swift as you would expect from small hotel. The room was just big enough to accommodate a double bed and about 1.5 feet, of space around the bed. This may come as a shock to many but remember this is a budget hotel. There was no cupboard no hanger either to hang extra clothing. The bed sheet and pillow was clean but looked worn-out. On one side of the bed there was small desk and mirror and on the other side there was a small window which surprisingly opened to a lush green field. The bathroom was small and relatively clean, stocked with some cheap toiletries. Another thing you should keep in mind that this hotel is located in a red-light district. But, I didn’t face any trouble during my 4 nights stay here. The place is rather calm and you won’t notice much of the activity unless you are looking for it. Even if someone approaches you just walk past silently and they will leave you alone.  There is no restaurant in the hotel but there are plenty of eateries near it. I would strongly recommend BBQ Box which on the left hand side of Geylang Road while coming from Kallang MRT. This place serves some amazing barbeques at a very reasonable rate.   In spite of all the shortcomings I would still recommend this hotel for budget travellers for three reasons – 1) Located near MRT and not very from CBD 2) Cheap and relatively clean 3) Lots of food options around the place.,…,We are aware of the bad side of the hotel, but then again we only want a bed to sleep at night and we also know that we get what we paid for but i never expected rudeness to the highest level from the front desk staff. It was not directed to us but we saw how they mistreated a guest by saying "" i dont care who you are, you are in Singapore not in your filthy country. You can call the police if you want to i dont care""... i mean wow i was stoned.",Budget,,,61,5,75
Hotel Conforto,3.5,140 reviews,#123 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Hindi, Malay","Share, ,Found it a bit odd that the main door for this hotel had the sign ""Rated on Tripadvisor"" and yet there were only 2 reviews so far. So might as well leave my notes.  For a business trip for 1 person - you really just need the basic things: clean comfort room with hot water, quiet air conditioning, and a decent bed. Check for all three for this hotel.  However, you REALLY just get those for at least 100 USD per night as a ""budget hotel"" for Singapore's standards. To give you a better picture, I'll share the other details here and it's up to you if you LIKE or UNLIKE this hotel.  ROOM: 1. Access key is really a KEY - which is very telling of the ""budget"". 2. There is TV with local channels. 3. They have the standard bathroom paraphernalia 4. They have the standard complimentary, coffee/milk tea sachets and water 5. There is a heater for potable water 6. No window - at night, you'll have the aircon ""power on"" and smoke detector led lights as your night light. 7. The WIFI couldn't connect in the room, for some reason. 8. The paint job could be improved. 9. The walls could be cleaned better - you know how your leather shoe sole could possibly make black marks on the wall if you accidentally brush up on it? Well, the wall has those when I arrived. These could be cleaned but I understand it would be a little difficult (but really possible).  HOTEL: 1. Clean and seems like everything is newly painted (better paint job outside than inside the rooms). 2. There is an elevator. 3. There is some privacy. A family with a small kid stayed in a room beside mine and I couldn't hear them, which is good. 4. There are computers and wifi on the ground floor, which I wasn't able to use tho. 5. Very good location (Mall, MRT, small eating areas nearby, taxi stations). 6. Safe (then again, this is Singapore's claim to fame).  For someone who stayed for 2 nights alone for business (out most of the day, drunk most of the night), it was a good stay. In personal trips, I sometimes think that the hotel payments can be a waste because you don't get to use the amenities for short stays, so this hotel made sense to me. However, for an additional 20 USD per night, you could technically get a better hotel (with at least a window to enjoy some view of the city).  I asked the receptionist if I could see some of the other (bigger) rooms so I could decide to stay here again.They didn't have any available I could see, which could have helped me make a better review at least or help me decide to stay here again. Now, I really don't know.  For business, maybe yes. For personal with the wife and baby and reminiscing such ""Kodak"" moments in the future, uhm probably not, sorry.  Hope you guys find this helpful.,…,I have made a boomig through Agoda and paying $80++ i should have lowee down my expectation considering the prime location. I got that so i checked in just expecting basic necessities.  Check in was good, room key was immediately given so i proceeded to second floor i was given 204. First thing i noticed is the cleanliness of the lift, filthy dirty that cleaners didnt bother to vaccuum or so. Upon entering the room, it has a decent bed, tv and a side table. I opened the window and it's a roof full of garbage from above and i need to close it immediately. I checked the bathroom and it is again FILTHY dirty, empty shower bottles are left in the rusty rack, floor, wall, sink ans the toilet bowl is full of dirt and molds. Towels smells funny and very old.  I went down and inform of, the room condition and told them that i am willing to wait for a room which has a clean bathroom. I went back at half past 2 and i was given a room in the first floor, it was 104. The room has no window and due to my complain, i can smeel a newly sprayed air freshener but as i checked the bathroom it was the same as my previous complain so i guess their defi nition of cleanliness is just running the water from the whole bathroom withoit disenfectig and scrubing. I rest my case since it is only for one night and i dont like to come out as fussy and vain.  Upon check out at 6am, an Indian guy which is sleeping so deep with his snores was seemed to piss off that i disturb him. I was asking for my $50 deposit and I was told, in our record ""NIL"" no deposit. It was my fault i have forgotten to take my receipt upon check out but their record should have shown and the man seems to tell me that i am trying to get something. As i saw there is a CCTV i have told him to check their CCtV record that i really did give a deposit. He even called the person who was on duty when i checked in to verify. Still, the guy is adamant to give me back my deposit and said he will handle as he has over of $50 when he took over the shift.  Cleanliness and integrity, it's a basic criteria which will definitely make me not to come back to this property again. ,…,The hotel localization is excellent, I can’t deny it. It’s in a really good area, really close to Clarke Quay and Chinatown, close to the subway station as well. Yes, this is the only good thing about this place. Yes, even if it were in the best place of earth and for free, I wouldn't stay there again.  First problem: I had made my reservation for this hotel 6 (six) months in advance, with a note that we were 2 male friends travelling so we wanted 2 single beds. When I arrived, no rooms with 2 single beds were available. Anyway, that was “ok”; those things happen sometimes.  The room was incredibly small. With the bed, bags and 2 people inside, a fly couldn't join us in the room. OK, it was cheap, that was my thought.   Room amenities: TV with no channels working, desk with lamp, from a country different from Singapore (socket didn't fit so we had to use our adapters), small closet. Some hangers available. AC. Internet: Free!! It might work in the rooms, if it doesn't, in the hall outside you might find a stronger wi-fi.  Bathroom (see pics): Shower with no stall and no warm water (although there was a decorative thermostat). Flooded bathroom after every shower. Water pressure of the shower and of the tap was more or less the same (really weak). At least Singapore is warm enough to make a cold “shower” acceptable.  If you stay in the room with final “1”, buy ear-plugs. Elevator makes a stunning noise every time it works (and once it runs from the ground floor to the 4th in some long minutes, it bothers you for a long time).  Employees (receptionists): I just realized they existed when the girl from reception kept on calling me in the room from 10 in 10 minutes when I was relaxing (not a joke) “at the management request” to make me go down to the lobby to pay the bill in advance (once I checked in during the night) – After staying there I noticed why they wanted me to pay in advance… I wouldn't be able to run away from there without paying – I must confess I was close to do that even after paying.  Still about receptionists: Poor English, poor education, poor training. They don’t say a simple and polite “hello” when you come in or “goodbye” when leaving. They don’t even look at you or check if you are a guest or not. I just can say the hotel is safe because Singapore is safe, and not because their safety precautions, that don’t exist… anyone can come in. I’m telling about the times there was someone in the lobby… sometimes there was nobody there (see pics, and pay attention that someone had left a bag in the reception probably due to early check in or late check out with nobody taking care of it).   The emergency exit (that I had to use with all my luggage when leaving the hotel because the elevator stopped working) faces the street, and that door was never locked. Anyone could easily use it to reach the rooms (well, it’d be unnecessary once receptionists don’t pay any attention in any way – it’d be easier to possible muggers to use the elevator).   During the night, the receptionists lay down in the lobby sofa to take a nap or play in their mobile phones.  I don’t usually write bad reviews here, If I do, it’s because I feel in obligation to warn people about serious problems, and it applies to this hotel.  My suggestion: Stay in a Hostel. It’s gonna be about the same price, and surely with much better conditions and even comfort.,…,Only few minutes from MRT Clarke Quay Station and China Town. I went to cheap meal in China Town (got nasi lemak for SGD2.00) and got few souvenirs as well.  Room was very simple but that's only I need. Clean bed and got room service every day. Good wifi connection as well.  I will come back to stay this hotel my next visit to Singapore.,The staff was very helpful.  The rooms are small but efficient and clean.  The internet works great in the room, no problems.  The location was the main attraction of this hotel.  Located right in Clarke Quay area, and walking distance to China Town and the Clarke Quay river to the Marina.  Would come here again.","Centrally Located,Budget",5753,Booking.com,630,111,100

Excellent view ftom swimming pool and from room overlooking city centre. King bed room is comfortable with a tepee bed for kids. Bathtub has a wooden tray with wine glass and vath salts are provided. Hogh tea served in room was excellent rith a variety of scones, cakes, macaroons,This is our second staycation in Sofitel City Centre this year. Just like the first time, everything was immaculate. Even though we had to take our meals in the room due to the heightened alert period, the meals always came delicious and in generous portions. Special thanks to Kelvin and Andrew for the assistance in checking in and making our stay perfect once again.,As an Accor Plus member, we stayed in this hotel at least once a year. It’s room quality and front desk services maintained its usual standards even though there appeared to be a drop in the number of staff on duty likely due to Covid-19 pandemic.  The dinner bill at Raccines has increased quite a bit likely due to a revision in their pricing. What is confusing is that in previous visits there are discounts for the drinks but this round none.  At the lounge we encountered conflicting service quality from the staff. The first waitress who seated us did not appear happy when we arrived at 9.45pm and told us that they are closing at 10.30am and that our first order will be the last order. However we subsequently encountered great service from another waitress who not only provide, us a bowl of peanuts and have also gone around asking for last orders at 10.15pm.,…,Booked the package with high tea  breakfast and autism resource gift set through Klook and with the utilization of our SRV vouchers  it wad $260/night which was affordable!   Check-in was smooth and package came with high tea which was really good as we got to try a good mix of 6 each of sweet and savoury canapes. High tea is highly recommended! Breakfast on the other hand was quite disappointing as the pastries and dim sum were quite hard and breakfast platter items were not appetizing (tomato and bacon was overcooked).   Room was clean, spacious and cozy. TV channels were limited but thankfully it could do a screencast. We were given a late check-out at 1pm which we appreciated as it gave us more buffer time after breakfast. We realised after leaving that we did not receive, the autism resource gift set unfortunately but we were given a care pack consisting masks, sanitizer & wipes for this period.,…,Stayed for a night on a weekday - we got a package that came with high tea at 1864 and late check out, which was extremely good value. Service was great throughout - they allowed one of us to check in early at 12pm to decorate the room for a birthday celebration, and brought amenities such as bedroom slippers without delay after we requested for them. The room was also spacious, modern, and clean. Nothing to shout about for breakfast, but there will be more than enough food even though it is no longer a buffet.  Sofitel is very accessible by public transport (right at tanjong pagar station), and there are many good eateries and restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. 100am mall is also just around the corner.

The Daulat,4.0,325 reviews,#182 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,Upon check-in on 29 Aug, there was a lift breakdown in the hotel and the reception couldn't get the vendor to fix it on the day itself or the day after. As I came with my 2 yo daughter in a stroller and the room that was assigned to me was on the third floor, you can imagine how inconvenient it was for me that I had to request for assistance to bring the stroller and my bags up to the room. This incident marred my experience even before stepping into the room.  As I was in a desperate need to unwind/getaway, I just booked the remaining room available (the loft room) via Agoda at a non-refundable rate, even when there were no photos shown of the room in the first place. If I'd known, I would have picked another room because the loft room wasn't suitable for small children. There, weren't enough safeguards to prevent children from falling over at the bed area.   Cons: Main door of room 303 needs to be shut by force. Water seeping into the main area after shower. Aircon temperature cannot be controlled manually. Soundproofing is bad. Noises can be heard along the corridor.  Pros: Room is modern and tasteful. Price is cheaper than most hotels in Singapore. Hotel comes with a small swimming pool (although it's not yet approved to reopen) Location is very near to the MRT.,…,Check in was a breeze. Hotel took into consideration our requests and acceded to it. The room was cozy and quite spacious for Singapore’s standard. The bed was comfortable and aircon was cold which is great for the hot weather. There was a smart tv in the room which is awesome as we could watch Netflix on it. There is a variety of food places around the hotel and 7-11 was just around the corner. If you’re looking for a no frills hotel, this is the place to be!,My stay was pretty good. Its a very direct and simple hotel and nice for staycation purposes if you dont intend to spend so much for one night.I was impressed with the room amenities cause I did not expect there will be ironing board+hairdryer and laundry bag to be available. The staff were helpful, I had problems when I entered my room cause I thought my room key card was not functioning properly but was further assisted by Azura and her colleague who guide me through.   If there was something that could be done better I would say it will be nice if emails were regularly check by the staff and revert back to the guest promptly. As before I chck in i emailed them informing tht my fiance will be checking in on my behalf first provided the document and called them as well but upon, her check in she had problems checking in because they require front and back of the IC and nt just the front. Understand different hotels have different procedures but this could have been avoided if there was a proper communication handled by the staff to reach out to the guest and inform on the missing document tht is required in the email.  Nevertheless I read the reviews on how impolite the staff is, and I would totally disagree. I was handled by polite and courteous staff all along and I had no problems with tht. Other than that the airconditioned in the room is manually operated by the hotel staff so if you want it to be adjusted to your preferred temperature the staff will have to assist you and you cannot do it on your own and that could be a problem as well, we would not want to always disturb the staff for just a temperature. thankfully we had a balcony so we just let the door ajar to let the cold air out a bit as it gets too chilly at night.   I still enjoyed my stay here. But I will say not to expect so much. You get what you pay for. You cannot expect a high 5 star quality service or room features if you're paying a few bucks. If you are petty you would want to opt this choice out. But if you are simple and easy this could be good for you.,…,Due to corona I had to cancel, thought booking.com says they have to give you a refund even on a non refundable booking, I had after about 10 emails NO reaction at all. They just ignored all of my friendly request for a refund or a voucher for next year. I consider tis way of getting along with clients  very impolite and unfriendly and for me a reason to never book there again and not recommend this hotel at all. We are all victime of the corona pandemic and we need to help each other out. We all loose.,We had a booking at this hotel through agoda, we have been advised by Agoda that this hotel is refusing to refund us even though Singapore is in lockdown to all foreign visitors. Absolutely disgusting behaviour in these times of crisis, our other hotel in Singapore was quick to refund us so I'll know who we will be staying with next time we are are in Singapore.  It sounds like they plan on keeping everyone's money even though they won't have any guests, perfect business model.","Mid-range,Boutique",,,281,54,100
Populous Hotel,2.5,35 reviews,#320 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,Welp, the reviews were true. The walls are horribly thin, i could hear the conversations and even listen to the shows they are watching as if i was listening to an audiobook. Horrible. DO NOT RECOMMEND. At least for the non window rooms,A relatively new & promising hotel if only they make improvements immediately on:  1. Pillows which are too soft and only 2 per room? Let's not be too stingy here. 2. No side table so if you're charging your phone, you either place it beside you or on the floor. 3. No rack in the shower room for your toiletries so you have to place it on the floor. 4. No tissue box in the room so you need to use the toilet roll (only 1 roll provided). 5. Air con cannot be turned off . 6. Roof garden which you cannot go up to without seeking help from staff. 7. Paper thin walls - you literally hear if your next door farts.,Literally the worst hotel I have ever come across, zero sound proof within the walls. You would literally hear what your neighbour are talking throughout the whole corridor. The pillow is like a thin piece of A4 paper, you are lying your head on.   It’s a Nightmare to even stay in this hotel for even one single day!  This hotel does not even deserve a rating, it is Terrible and Horrible!!!,Bad attitudes,small rooms,noises next door,impolite and terrible manager. Bedsheets stained, overall 1/10. Never to stay!!!!!! Spoiled moods after staying. No security, cold atmosphere no warm hospitality!!!!!! AVOID!!!!!,The twin rooms are far too small for 2 people. So small there’s isn’t even a bedside locker table for either bed. So, no place for phones, iPads, or even a glass of water. All had to be kept in the bed with you !!!!!Space between the beds 23 cms with one bed right up against the wall. The other bed had an amazing 34 cms to the bathroom wall.  We were at the start of a 3 week trip around SE Asia and 2 large suitcases wouldn’t fit into the room. So we had to book a second room. This hotel is a false economy. If there are 2 of you, it’s far cheaper to book a more expensive hotel with a decent size room. Our 2 night stay worked out very expensive.",,,,709,77,100
Check-Inn @Little India,3.5,80 reviews,#199 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,Staff was friendly. Room was clean and tidy. Small and cosy room. Toilet was really small though. But can't really say much for the small room.   Except there was some bed bugs that was biting me and I was itchy all over my legs. You can smell the mosquito repellent from the walkway probably suggesting that there are mosquitoes around.  Great location as it is just right outside little India exit E.   For the price I paid, the room was definitely worth it.,I had a terrible stay at Park 22 in room 304 from 14th-16th August.  When I first arrived at the room, the door was wide open and there was a stool holding the door open. When I went in the room there was a strong gush of toilet and chlorine smell.  The receptionist said they’re fully booked and offered to get a housekeeper aunty to help spray some air freshener.  We agreed and after a day the smell worsened from toilet and chlorine to a damp foul laundry and chlorine smell. We realized the toilet had absolutely no ventilation at all. The floor was wet the entire day and we had to sleep through the smell.  We explained what happened to the receptionist and she suggested we pay extra to get an upgrade to ‘The observatory’ room 212. We agreed because we didn’t want to return back, to room 304.  With the total bill, at that price point we could have gotten a decent and pleasant staycation in other hotels like Hotel 1888 and ST Signature, which would have been cheaper, cleaner and not as old.  Other than that, you can see from the images, ‘The Cosy’ felt like a store room with the inclined ceiling that felt like its directly above our bed. There were yellow liquid stains dripping from the ceiling to the bed (last image). The toilet was small and terrible.  Overall it was a very uncomfortable stay that was not worth its price. You can check out the other reviews I’ve given on google maps and they were all exceedingly great, this one is a huge disappointment.,…,Was told to provide a compulsory 100 dollars deposit in cash or credit card, and when I mentioned I only had a debit card, the staff Amanda was still insistent to collect the deposit.  Told her I didn't had cash, and to just take down the debit card details instead, which was what ALL other hotels, 3 stars or 5 stars have been doing for all the staycays I have gone to, she still further insisted to offer and help me ""check"" on my card. Ended up holding a 100 dollars off my debit card which can only be returned to my acc a month or more later. Splendid.   I requested to void it off, which was just a push of a button, but she couldn't do it. I have handled a EDC before and I knew it was jus a button away. Instead, she offered to email an urgent cancellation request, same as the, agent Mandy who did the Check Out for me said as well. No idea if it will even be done, no proof, all jus words.   Honestly, for a one night stay at a 3 star hotel, its ridiculous to ask for a COMPULSORY AND HEFTY 100 DOLLARS DEPOSIT. The deposit itself costed more than my stay LOL. Most hotels on the higher end only asked for 50 PER NIGHT minimum. I wonder what incidental charges are they worried about. The empty minibar or the stealing of their old and stained bedsheets? Won't be back again for the inflexibility and lack of empathy from staffs.,…,SO MUCH LOVE for this quaint and minimalistic hotel!! Took the observatory room and for 2 pax? Its quite big and comfortable!   They provide lavender spray in the room so can spray to have a good night sleep! Bed is so amazing.   Altho our room is at level 1? it is not noisy at all. for a light sleeper me, i was able to get a good night sleep!  Will definitely be back again! ,even tough the  rooms are bit small, very clean hotel. I really liked the location,  it's right next to train station. rooms are quite clean and amenities are fine. really enjoyed my time there, affordable.","Centrally Located,Budget",10401,Expedia,187,40,99
Hotel Mono,4.0,211 reviews,#150 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I read reviews about the poor sound insulation, so I rang up the staff in advance to ask if I could get a room where it is further away from the lift/stairs so that I won't be distracted by noise because I am a light sleeper. They accommodated so fast and Spencer at the reception was such a wonderful person to chat with! He was super friendly and inviting, and totally raised the morale.  I booked a Deluxe Double and although it was a small room, I really liked the interior. The bathroom was beautiful. Bed was hard and slightly springy (perfect, I dislike soft beds). TV was alright but it isn't a smart TV, but it's cool. There are bedside tables and charger ports. Room also had a card in it other than the card we got, so it was convenient if my partner had to leave to get, something and I can just stay in the room to do my work.  Some visible wear and tear can be seen in the room though, like walls or window panes having cracked paint or losing colour, or the black floor having scratches and marks that were not painted over. It does not really bother me though, as long as it is clean.   However some downsides: - Found 2 baby brown-banded cockroaches. Killed both. - The floor under the bed is pretty dusty. - The mugs and metal spoons were not cleaned. I saw coffee ground stains and had to rewash them thoroughly using hand soap.  - Mini-fridge was not very cold and it was not clean.  - Toilet bowl was not scrubbed clean (bowl had stains). - Plastic cups provided in the bathroom for brushing were not clean either. - The soap dispenser bottles have some stains. - I suppose this comes with being a shophouse-hotel, sound insulation is still not that good because around 2am, I can still hear noise from the outside. - The water in the shower will turn colder the longer you stay in the shower.,…,Thank you Spencer and Team for making our style a pleasant one. We truly appreciate your hospitality and for making us feel welcomed.   Spencer was really friendly and the conversations we had with him was lax, casual and as if talking to a good friend. He made the experience a whole lot more enjoyable by recommending what to eat around there and of course with his jokes along the way to brighten the conversation.  The room was cleaned and well maintained, with a unique touch of a monochromatic theme to really stand out from your usual hotel room. although the TV does not have a HDMI input for our movie night, we ended watching channels such as HBO, Fox Movies and Chinese classics.   Price was also very reasonable given the location; we were surrounded by a food haven and a few, minutes walk from Chinatown Point / Chinatown Complex.   Overall, it was a wonderful stay this National Day weekend! Thank you team once again .,…,Stayed 1 night in mono. I would say it was kind of disappointing seeing how good the reviews were. Comfort level was not there.   Pros: 1. Good location 2. Polite staff  Cons:  1. Room was small, the table was small and uncomfortable, how can anyone possibly use their laptop and work there if need to. 2. Room is very bare and basic, the finishing wasn't good, wall paint dirty at some areas, it is just pretty raw, I hate the floor tiles.  3. Aircon could not be switched off when it gets too cold, u can only turn it up.  4. The room was damp in the morning, condensation on the floor tiles, floor was damp, u can't go bare foot, even the room slippers make u slip cos the floor was wet.  5. Bedsheets felt like it had a sticky layer, I have probably slept in at least 20-30 hotels room, cos I have been travelling for 30 years and stayed in budget/business/luxury hotel and apartments, but never encountered bed sheets that felt like this. I could hardly sleep.  6. Noise, its true, u can hear people walking, talking along corridors, and tv noise from other rooms. pretty bad.  7. Toilet shower head was mouldy.,…,This boutique hotel is conveniently located a stone’s throw away from Chinatown MRT, just walk past a row of shophouses and you’ll see the distinct black-and-white 3-storey shophouse that has been converted into Hotel Mono.   The room is surprisingly spacious for a shophouse boutique hotel and very clean. Every furniture is only in black and white colors. Unique monotone. We have two comfortable queen beds with four pillows on each bed, a sofa bed, a fixed long table to the wall that can seat two persons. There is also a proper wardrobe for us to hang our clothes and a side bench to put our bags and luggage. The bathroom is not big but sufficient, and we love the scent of the body wash and shampoo. The bath towels are also soft and fluffy.   This hotel doesn’t have the luxury of, swimming pool, gym or restaurant/cafe but it’s good enough for a short staycation. Finding food is not a problem as there are a lot of eateries and restaurants in the area, and you can also walk over to Chinatown Point and People’s Park Complex for a great variety of food.   Will we be back to Hotel Mono? Most probably and this time we may try the loft room with the loft bed, and when dining out is allowed again. ,…,Room is smaller than expected although true to pictures.  The front office staff were absolutely kind and friendly.   Basic toiletries are provided in a pouch; shampoo, bathing soap, sanitary bag, toothbrush set, shaving kit, slippers, hairdryer etc. Two towels per set, consisting of a large and small one.  Water kettle is provided, along with coffee and tea.   Windows can be opened.  Surrounding is amazing as there were so many food options.  Walking distance to Chinatown MRT & Chinatown Point.  Recommended restaurant: 东方美食  Some room for improvement:  The mini fridge is not very cold. Cleanliness could be better as there are a couple small ants on the table, bedside tables were a little dusty.

Park View Hotel,3.0,272 reviews,#239 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Pro: 5 min walk to Bugis station Decent room size for Singapore A nice breakfast, with some options(egs, noodles, rice, butter, juice, etc) Clean and good hotel supplies: slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste, 4 towels etc We had a room with back view and it was very quiet   Cons: It is walking distance to all the places, but is about 30-40 min The staff is ok but very ""basic"" The hotel and the rooms need some refreshing work  I would stay again here because of the price/amenities/location ratio! ,The room was very clean. The sheets and towels were in great condition. The food provided during breakfast was okay but needed to be more varied. My main problem was with the people serving the breakfast. The cornflakes box has a spoon inside which means that the cornflakes gets infected with the germs on people’s hands as a result of using the spoon and placing it inside. I spoke to Jennifer , the one wearing a suit and I told her that I would like to have some cornflakes from the carton inside the kitchen and she told me they don’t have. A few minutes later I discover she is lying to me and I find the box refilled with more cornflakes. She was not supportive at all and lied to me. I wouldn’t stay here again,My experience to that hotel it start bad from when i come at check in the staff it was with no smile at all i try to ask what to do around cause it was my first time here theybwas boring to answer me i said ok then i went to the room it was like a prison no windows and when i was closing the AC the walls and my clothes was full of humidity next day i went for breakfast the breakfast its so poor that is better to sleep and go to 7eleven to eat a toast but that was not my problem i was eating one frie egg and i found inside a HAIR thats the worst thing for me in the food i told to the staff and they told me would you like to bring you new eggs like it was cold or something next day in the morning i try to sleep and yessss they did maintenance next to my door i told them to stop, kindly and they was ignoring me the staff here is unhelpful its firt time in my life i found this things in a hotel that ask a lot of money for what they provide!

The location is great on Beach raod close to Bugis MRT station, restaurants, shopping centers. Room with no window is a bit small but not too small for 2 people. Breakfast could be better. Staff are helpful. ,Stayed for 4 nights over the F1 weekend.  I have to say that the hotel is in a superb location in relation to the F1 track and Marina bay in itself. It's also close to the Hop-on/Off bus terminal and Mall.  The hotel itself is pleasant enough and the staff were nice throughout.  I didnt have the breakfast so cant comment.  We weren't in the hotel a lot.  The hotel is quiet despite being on a main road.  The main negative is that the beds are hard but i still slept well.  For some people this may be a bigger negative than it was for more.

Champion Hotel City,4.0,130 reviews,#3 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean","Share, ,I have visited their hotel from 8 May to 11 May, unfortunately, there were many fleas.  Bites are itchy and painful. Although the hotel is convenient and the environment is ok. I feel really upset and painful.,Very near Clarke-Quay MRT Station if you’re taking it from (and back) the airport but you’ll have to make 3 transfers and walk about a kilometer to the hotel once you finally get off.  Just make sure you take Exit A as it’s the closest one.  Although modern-looking. the hotel’s façade is small.  There’s a coffee machine (it’s free) at the small lobby although cold drinks would be more appropriate in a place that’s hot and humid most of the year.  But you could request extra bottled water from the cleaning lady.  Check-in was straight-forward (manned all the time) and decent-sized elevator will whisk you up to your room.  The room is rather modern with a glass-enclosed, 5 square-feet area for the bathroom.    The bed is elevated with the space underneath serving as storage area, for one big luggage and cabinets that revealed a small fridge (it did not do much to cool our drinks), a safe & a drawer.  The latter 2 are underneath the steps.  If you’re handicapped, this set-up may not work for you as you have to take 2-3 flights of steps to settle in the queen-sized bed.    Sheets are clean but extra sets of pillow could help very tired bodies get better rest in a place where the weather is like being inside a toaster oven each day.   There’s a dresser but most of the space on top is occupied by an alarm clock (setting the correct time is a puzzle in itself), an electric pitcher, 2 mugs & glasses with a few packets of instant coffee mix.  A drawer reveals the hair dryer & writing pad - pen set.   It also lacked a cabinet for hanging one’s clothes.  There were no plain hangers either.  A stylized ladder on the foot of the bed where a phone sat seem to serve this purpose –but, again, no good if you’re handicapped.  Overhead aircon is great – we had it all the way down to the coldest every time.  The 28-inch TV had only standard OTA channels.  WiFi was OK.  We were given a password that we don’t even need to connect.  The bathroom’s fixtures are modern with good pressure from both the cold & hot taps when using the handheld shower spout.  Pressure diminishes once you switch to the overhead shower.  If going to Chinatown, don’t take the MTR.  Just walk across the Hong Lim Park opposite the hotel & it’s just another block away.  People’s Park Complex is also there where you can have cheap ‘hawker-style’ food.    Another 'hawker food center' near Chinatown would be 'Maxwell Food Center' where some of the best Hainanese 'chicken rice' stalls in Singapore can be found.  Again, just walk slowly, as, even if you just had a shower a minute ago at the hotel, you’ll find yourself already perspiring even at 6 AM once you start to wander around the streets of Singapore.  Overall, for the price we paid for a room for two (US$97 a night) – we rated it as 2.5 to 3-star hotel- we found the place to be a bit pricey for the cramped space it provided.,…,The rooms in this hotel are small but it’s a fantastic place to stay if you are out and about sightseeing most of the day.   The rooms are about the size of a cabin on a ship but they are very modern looking and spotlessly clean.  We stayed on level 5 and there is a verander that you can go and sit on outside. Free coffee is offered downstairs in the foyer so we use to go and get a free tea and coffee and bring  it up and sit on the verandah every morning which was great before we headed out.  As for location I would have to say it is the best in Singapore - Clarke Quay.   Originally we had planned to take the hop on hop off bus so we could see everything but because of where the hotel was positioned we ended up being able to walk everywhere in every direction and didn’t need to, take any form of transport.  I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and the staff were so very nice as well. We will definitely stay here again.,…,The hotel is near to clarke quay MRT station which can take you anywhere in Singapore afterwards. Also close to the Clarke Quay for a nightlife experience.   Nice clean minimalist room, nice friendly staff.  Great stay!,We stayed at Champion Hotel for three nights and found our stay and experience pleasurable and value for money.  The good aspects of our stay involved the friendly staff at reception and cleaners. We have to credit one member of the maintenance staff for helping us fish out a necklace which dropped down the shower room sink! He kindly took apart the U-bend and assisted us in retrieving it! Great help.  Another positive pointer about this hotel is that the air conditioning was powerful and fully functional during our stay. In fact, our room was generally very good throughout, clean and made-up well. However, there was one small issue with the wood effect boxing-in housing the safe. The door hinge had come away completely (see images). Whilst it wasn’t impossible to move the binge, so to gain access to the safe itself, this is worth mentioning just so it is fixed for future guests. This is in Room 503. On top of this, the fridge located in the cupboard beneath the bed did not appear very cold at all. Whilst it worked, the drinks we put in there remained at room temperature and weren’t as cool as you’d expect. Aside from these issues, as mentioned, our stay was enjoyable and the room satisfied our needs.  The hotel is located roughly a fifteen minute walk from The Marina and is in close proximity to Clarke Quay, China Town and a stroll over Elgin Bridge to The Fullerton Hotel.  Another thing to note is that the hotel will charge a 10 SGD deposit for the use of an umbrella and you are given this money back immediately upon its return. Hopefully you won’t need one during your time in Singapore.  Thank you, Champion Hotel. We enjoyed our stay.,…","Charming,Centrally Located",,,749,101,100

The room was no bigger than the small cabins I've had on cruise ships. There was very little space for luggage. But there was a nice queen sized bed, the room was thoroughly cleaned daily, and the AC worked great (a necessity in Singapore!). Oddly, there was no shower curtain in the bathroom.  Evidently the Geylang neighborhood is in the legal red light district! Our daughter, who made the reservations, didn't know this until she arrived, when a random stranger on the metro warned her against staying in the area! However, we never observed any worrisome activity nor was my husband ever approached by anyone soliciting business. Nor does this hotel rent rooms by the hour! :-) I mention this just in case you hear this, about the area. It was NOT a problem.  The other item of note about the Geylang neighborhood is that it is the home of a particular specialty: Frog Porridge. There are several restaurants in the area which advertise it prominently.

Small room but compact and well-utilised. Like the sony smart tv with Netflix. The shophouse feel of the room is great as the huge windows of the shophouse allows plentiful light into the room.   The area near the doorway mirror needs some lighting as it is dark.   One should also note that rooms facing the street opposite potato head restaurant tend to be noisy at night. Other than that, the hotel is good for relaxation and value for money. The complimentary drinks and snacks at the lobby is a plus too.,Brought my partner here. Very warm and friendly service. Highly recommended 👌  nice ambience in a quaint small restaurant.  Tried the mentaiko pasta and truffle fries was tasty and worth the money paid,Great ambience with good music choice, chic decor, good food, excellent and meticulous service. Will be back here to try other dishes with another group. Able to get a table without reservation on Monday night but not sure if weekends will be crowded,You check in at 3pm and you have to check out at 11.. that's less than 24 hrs. I wanted to extend half a day but the counter claimed full house; there's availability shown in booking app. The 'suite' room is quite cosy, not big.... the Internet tv lags, the movie voice don't sync.  The worst of all- the throw pillows (cushion) smells of someone's head sweat eewww. The back yard looks like Katrina just went by...,Vibe is very good! The staff were well equipped with information and went extra mile to get me the things i needed. There are free can drinks and nuts behind the reception for consumption. All is well just that the noise cancellation is not the best. But overall a 5 star stay!",,21343,Official Hotel,672,102,100

RedDoorz near Marine Parade Central,4.0,45 reviews,#202 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,Was suppose to stay one night at this budget hotel. It was almost perfect but something spoils my stay. Hotel room is very small but still acceptable. Location very good as you have plenty of eateries and also convenience store just a few steps away.  What's great about this hotel?? I like their bed sheets, pillows (there are 4 pillows), the Water pressure, the in-house soap, the towels (you know towels at budget hotels? They are mostly worn out but this one quite new, soft and good).  What spoils my day their AIR CON is really horrible!!!! I set it to 18 degrees Celsius but the room is still hot and stuffy. The fan although is set to the max but it is very weak!!!! Even after 4 hours of turning it on, the room is still not cold. There is no cable TV (sigh). The bed is horrible, as it seems like someone who is 300kg been sleeping on it for years without moving. The middle part of the bed sinks so when you lie down your back hurts as it is not flat. Luckily I only booked for one night.... Not sure about other rooms or even other hotel from this chain. Not sure why other people gives such good ratings... But this is definitely my honest review. ,…,I'm very pleased with my 4D3N stay at this hotel tucked away in the East. The single room is clean, comfortable and big enough for you to place your luggage. The bathroom is clean too with toiletries provided.  There are many eateries and drinking places within walking distance from the hotel. Getting around with public transport is easy too as there is a nearby bus stop. The only drawback I had was the noise caused by inconsiderate noisy guests hanging out at the terrace outside my room.,Have just been there! From Thailand... visa runs!!! One day trip... so it was important to find a good balance between distance from airport and price. This was a terrific choice... cheap and in the middle of a lot of small shops and restaurants Value for money! The room was indeed rather small but everything else was perfect and made my one- day trip a joyful experience  I will come back to Singapore... and this hotel!,Finally tried out reddoorz Hotel. It was different environment and ambience. The looby is quite straight forward. Not advisable to sit and wait there due to insufficient space.  Upon going to our room, it was a maze. The directions wasn't clear enough but we manage to figure it out. Turns out that our room was facing the outdoor terrace. Now that's a different setting.  While checking out the terrace, we came across the vending machine. It was unique and convenient (see photo attached).  Now the room description. It was nice. But was what off-putting was the standard of the room. The curtain have stains. And the sticker on the toilet seem full of stains too. With all these basic maintenance, it will be better impression. ,Am a regular on short one day or two transit trip to Singapore. Inhouse facilities are fair for price paid but the main reason I always choose it in spite of its lacking fridge, lick safe and unstable wifi, is always made up by the excellent, friendly and welcoming reception by Ms Maya; plus the close proximity to great food and shopping areas in Katong and Marine Parade.",,,,156,16,79

I think we were the only Westerners in the whole area, room was so small you could hardly move. There was no shower screen or curtain and it wasn't clean. The sheets had stains on them. Was so noisy it wasn't funny, the cleaners started early with the tv in the rooms on full waking the whole floor up. Should have been tipped off with all the prostitutes out the front of this hotel. We had organised a late check out before we got there but couldn't get out of the place fast enough, don't bother.,We stayed here for 5 nights and was worth the price. Singapore is expensive and this was one of the cheaper places to stay. The hotel is 10mins walk from Aljunied MRT and that is the easiest public transport to use in Asia!  The wifi doesn't work as well on iPhones as you need to connect first, then type in a webpage given by hotel staff and then log in. But worked fine once on it.  The bed was okay and room a decent size.  The hotel is in an area where there are some questionable things going on but don't let that put you off. We had no trouble, people were nice and helpful. Less English was spoken here but still had no issues.  There's a hawker stall 2 mins away that do decent  cheaper food (2 SDR for meal).  Recommend this if you're out and about and happy with basics of a, hotel! ,…,Singapore is an expensive place to stay - and when you are there, it's invariably hot!  This Hotel 81 is better than those I have tried of the Hotel 81 group, better than those of the Fragrance group too.    Geylang is obviously not for those who want tidy streets, free of girls of the night - but it is a reasonable part of Singapore for one night stop-overs as its half way from airport to city centre.  This Hotel is one of the cleaner places, with cheerful and helpful staff.  Small rooms but OK bedding.  They kept my luggage safe after check out while I took the bus into town (nearby stop), and its not too far from the rail link to the airport - frequent trains.  There is even an OK church near the Aljunied Station - both Chinese and English services!  The food stalls nearby, should keep most people happy too, and if you ignore the street girls, they will not pester you.    It's a shame that for my next trip, there are no vacancies - otherwise I would have stayed there again.  I have called it ""avarage"" overall, only because it is not ""very good"".,…,My partner and I had wanted to book into this hotel.   Anyway, to cut a long story short, due to a certain issue, the staff Leong Chan Ying Kit  raised his voice at me and in an insolent manner. When I asked how I wasn't going to stay at their hotel anymore after being treated this way!  I had emailed Hotel 81 mgt and tried calling them but of course, there is no reply. They have conveniently disappeared.  This is a budget hotel chain, but I didn't expect them to be budget on manners and training as well.   Be warned!",,,,65,5,78

With two comfortable queen size bed and the best part, we had access to netflix and youtube on the TV. Toilet was very clean too despite it being so small, but it was enough for just a night. no complains. The only thing my friends and i had a slight issue with was the mirror. It was surprisingly dark and also the dim yellow lights above us, made it hard for us to see ourselves when applying makeup. I had to use my compact powder’s mirror to do so, while facing towards the window where there’s natural sunlight.

Internet was top class, very fast and high download/ upload rate which was useful as I was downloading and posting photos from my summer holidays to my blog.

Surrounding area contain a number of small local restaurant and a 24 hour supermarket is very close to hotel,After checking-in, I requested for extra towels from Front Desk at around 5PM on 01/02/2020. The gentleman who was manning the front desk at that point in time was extremely rude by judging us for needing extra towels and asking unnecessary questions such as asking why do we need more towels. I explained that I prefer more towels for showering but denied our request rudely. I told him that this was the first hotel that I stayed in that does not provide extra towels on request, and the gentleman replied me rudely by saying that I was the first guest who requests for extra towels. Very terrible service and I felt uncomfortable as a guest.  Other than that, the common area and room itself was okay. It was a little cramped and the room was basic, but it is to be expected for such a, hotel concept. At least the room was clean and decently kept.  Would not recommend simply due to the terrible service I received,…,I had recently stayed in a Deluxe Double bedroom (without windows) at Q Loft Hotels @ Bedok.  This room had a double bed with a firm mattress and a comfortable bed sheet and pillows.  We had to stay for a few hours in this room before our next flight from Changi airport.  The price I had paid for this room was far better than that of dayrooms available at Changi.  The cab fare from the airport to this hotel was about 20 Singapore dollars. This room would be appropriate for a one-night stay because there was not much room to move around with our carry-on luggage stored inside the room  The attached bathroom was clean, but the shower was not covered.  That meant if we had taken a shower, the water would have spilled all over the floor of the bathroom.  The attendant at the, reception of this hotel was quite helpful and arranged for our cab when we were ready to go back to the airport.  Free breakfast was available in the morning at the hotel.  Several restaurants were located below this hotel - where we could order dinner.  On the overall, I would recommend a one-night stay at this hotel in between flights.,…",,,,97,6,64
The Inn at Temple Street,3.0,407 reviews,#214 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian","Share, ,The room is cozy enough for an overnight stay, with some kind of elemental vintage vibes. The front desk staff and the housekeeping attendants all portrayed very good service, specifically the Indian lady who really made sure that the room was alright. The location is a plus as well.,Too old, too dirty & smelly like haunted room, not same like photo. Furniture not clean at all. he rooms are tiny, dust on all surfaces, cobwebs & dirt hanging from filthy air conditioning unit. Can hear someone talking in our room. Will not stay again.,This is less than a basic hotel. For “antique"" read “run down"" Most hotels are acceptable if clean, this was not. The rooms are tiny, dust on all surfaces, cobwebs & dirt hanging from filthy air conditioning unit. All furniture and walls grubby. Bathroom door doesn't work. This hotel would not be star rated at all in the UK and I can only guess that the positive views have come from people more used to hostel type accommodation. Someone wrote that the shower was powerful, not on the 3rd floor it's not, 50 steps up. And the toilet space was described by a previous poster about legroom. I’m average height and I had to sit side saddle. The room felt permanently damp and humid. I know Singapore is humid, but I have just spent a week in just as humid Malaysia and the room was fine., The sheets did not fit the bed and continually rode up to expose bare mattress. The location is great for Chinatown and close to an MRT station but, although it is a bit rowdy at night with girls touting outside bars for ‘buisness', the hotel is not great A plus is that the staff were pleasant enough. Luckily they supply slippers too, as you wouldn't want to step on the carpet. This site is Tripadvisor and I only usually post comments when I have something genuine to say, good or bad. my advise is to try elsewhere. ,…,I chose this hotel mainly because it’s in Chinatown where there are lots of food stalls and bargain goods. I wasn’t expecting too much from this hotel as their rate isn’t that expensive. But lo and behold, i was surprised by the Class A service i got, the staff were very polite, friendly and accommodating, the rooms were nice, aircons were in good working condition. Special mention to the lady from fookien doing the room clean up, very friendly and honest, i left my wristwatch on the table and some bills and coins, i wasn’t touched at all. It was a great stay at a reasonable price. Great location, great place to stay. Simply class A in all aspects,Room on 1st floor, tucked away right at the back, so no outside noise at all, room fairly small, me and my luggage = room full!!!

Bed is quite comfortable but the comforter and pillow cases are with stains.   One of the light is not working. Wall cracks and paint came off. Room condition is average.  Rooms are very close to one another, could hear next door flushing toilets or when they cough. No sound proof.   Bathroom and basin is extremely small.  If you need a cheap stay just for hours usage, this is the place but if you need a quiet peaceful rest at night, not here. ,Located in the city but in a downmarket industrial area, Hotel Snow has a very slightly lower than average tariff, but only if you book it online. Walk-in rates are higher than proportionate amenities. Rooms are very small and suitable for solo travellers or those who want to transit for a few hours. It is close, but not too close, to the red light area, which is also a foodie paradise for local delicacies.,I wasn’t expecting much for the price, but I do expect cleanliness. I booked a single windowless room for a stopover between flights. The room is tiny, which would be fine if the bathroom wasn’t so slimy and mouldy. Even walking sideways it was impossible to bump against the mouldy bathroom walls.   I booked through Qantas Hotels and expected that there was some sort of vetting process, but apparently not.   The one positive was the delicious and cheap open-air Indian restaurant on the corner.,I reached hotel around 3pm and room still not ready, when it's ready I got smelly room, guest before me smoked in that room, when I asked to change the room the owner not allowed it because no single room anymore, it just soo bad because I also pay for the room I asked for 2 times still he not gave, so I can't sleep properly bcoz of that,Been stay here for 2 times and will be back to this hotel (if i have a night transit flight). Affordable price and close to MRT station and restaurant (subway, kopitiam, and even grocery store). The room quite small but it’s ok for short stay.  Been trying in a single room and twin room, i think the single room is better, because the tv position. In the twin room, you can’t watch the tv (even if you didn’t want to because you’re busy exploring the city), because the tv is right above your bed. It’s different with the single room, nice and i can watch the tv. They provide wifi but sometimes can’t connected somehow(?).

Highly recommended!,We would like to extend our greatest thanks to Ms Gowri Ganesan, Weddings and Social Events Manager, for her impeccable handling of our wedding banquet in December 2021. We are especially grateful to her for patiently and efficiently fulfilling all of our many last minute requests and amendments.

The service rendered has been highly professional and the staff have gone above and beyond in guiding us through every step of the way. Great care was ensured to keep us informed of changes to banquet regulations in response to Covid measures, and furthermore to recommend our best course of action in each instance. Any queries or uncertainties, that we faced were also swiftly answered and clarified.  We would additionally like to express our gratitude to Farhan, the AV and Banquet manager on the scene during the banquet itself.

I stayed here for 4 nights and have a good experinece here. Davin is very friendly and helps me change my room from the first floor to the second floor. Recommend!,I booked this hotel to do some work and also attend a seminar. The night before I booked I called the hotel to ask what time is the earliest I could check-in. I was informed by a lady 10:30am is the earliest. I proceeded to make the booking.  The next day I called as I was approaching the hotel nd I was attended by a very rude front desk staff by the name of Brian. he told me a completely different set of rules. He was such a bully and extremely rude. You can check in now but you have to get out by 6pm. Otherwise the check-In is at 2pm. Even after explaining to him he refused to budge. Basically he was telling me take it or leave it. I asked to speak with the manager to which Brian mentioned he would say the same thing as he did. I told him I'll take my chances to which Brian, replied he's fast asleep and does not wished to be disturbed. I told him I was on the way.   As I approached, he was so cocky. He told he would allow me to check-In at 12pm. I agreed and told him that I need to take the seminar zoom call and as such I would be waiting for 12pm in the lobby. To that he mentioned I am not allowed to loiter. I was not loitering as I am guest. He then calls the police citing I was causing trouble.  Fortunately, with the help of the police, I was able to speak with the Manager who kept apologising for the staff's incompetence. The manager mentioned that he should have called for the police for this minor issue. The manager then allowed me to check-in immediately. The very manager Brian mentioned that his manager will say the same thing as he did. Obviously the manager knows everything about customer service. Brian needs to go for further training as he obviously thinks that he owns the hotel.   I have never met anyone as cocky, ride and obnoxious as him. He was such a bully. the temperature was broken and when I asked him about it, he refused to answer.

The room is not so big, but everything is fine. The reception desk is open 24 hours, wifi connection was very OK at that time, and the room was clean. There is a food court near the hotel with a lot of variety of food, In short this hotel is highly recommended to people who look for accommodation during their medical check-up, or accompany a family member who hospitalized. ,The space is just enough for a bed and a side table. TV was mounted on the wall at the foot of our bed and the bathroom had just enough space for a shower and toilet. Then again, all this is for a ""budget"" price, though you'd get much more from a hotel in Indonesia. Best part about this place is the food court just across the street.,Hotel room cleanliness not good enough which had caused me not comfortable to stay again in future. Furthermore I have found that there were short term with 2 hours stay service also available in this hotel. It was really big impact to the hotel bad image. Anyhow the location of this hotel good,I just checked out of the hotel an hour ago after a two days stay, to be closed to the location of my project. What I needed were all assessable and met my expectations of a budget hotel that charges SGD81 on off peak and SGD109 on peak season. The bed and washroom were tidied up and cleaned immediately or rather soon after I walked out of the hotel for work. It's a very quite and ""non-intrusive"" hotel that gives you a lot of privacy. However, if you need something, like an extra bottle of water, a towel or a phone charger, the receptionist will very quickly send it up to your room with just a phone call. You feel ""cut out"" from the hussle-bussle of the outside world when you return from work. Yet looking out of the window you can spot places you want to go for dinner after a, nice warm shower. Cleanliness is maintained very consistently as I have stay weeks in a row in the past one year or more. The staffs than to remember their regular guest and will automatically offer you the best discounted rate possible upon your check in, without reservation. I will recommend this hotel to travellers, business or leisure, who is budget conscious and do not spend much time in the room but expect a nice relaxing rest when you return.,…,Hotel are very Easy to find, in the front of  Balestier Market at Balestier Road..

Hope they can do something about this rude and pathetic agent they hired.,This hotel is located in the midst of shops and coffee shops. Making convevenient for us to eat and drink.

I believe it is a bit absurd for the guest to vacate the room for 4 hours as it will take only 20 mins maximum to make up the room. Anyway I would still recommend this hotel to travellers who like a convenient located hotel in the midst of coffee shops. Cheers to the staff of Amrise hotel for making a pleasant stay for me.,It's a decent budget hotel. It has a T. V. with cable, air conditioning & the nearest MRT stations are Kallang (preferred) and Alljunied. The area is a safe place to be, there's a hawker Center close to Alljunied station plus fancy restaurants. ",Budget,,,68,6,76
ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel,4.0,"7,330 reviews",#100 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,i like Ibis Bencoolen Hotel, location very closed to central city, cleaned and secure. event the room is budget size but they give very variative breakfast menu. many times i stayed here whenever arrived at Singapore for business or holiday.,I spent 2 night at this hotel and all the service that provided by this hotel is amazing.   I try the breakfast and taste is not that bad but also not that good. Hopefully the taste can be improved.   I’ve had great stay in this hotel.  Thank You,This was my second stay at Ibis Bencoolen.   Being an Accor Gold Member, I was allowed early checkin at 10 AM and late checkout until 4 PM and welcome drink.   Breakfast was really nice, with great variety.  Recommended for Business and Budget Travellers.,This was our first time at this hotel, and won’t be our last. Friendly check in, the concierge who took our bags was so helpful. Close to restaurants, hop on hop off, public transportation. Room was smaller but very clean and well maintained during our four night stay. We chose the buffet breakfast inclusion. The food was really good, lots of choice. Coffee was delicious. I had two pills on the table to take, a server ran to get me a glass of water! ,Firstly, the good points: Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly receptionists, lovely breakfasts - buffet style, and a good place to have a meal and a drink in the evening if you've worn yourselves out in the day. Again, the staff here are extremely friendly. The hotel is conveniently located with public transport just around the corner. It is possible to walk downtown, too. There are some good quality local restaurants, cafes, etc. right outside the hotel. Our only niggle was the deposit which I was obliged to make when we arrived. $600 which did not reappear on my card until 6 weeks later! Imagine if I had to do that in every hotel! There must be a better way. However, we would stay here again if visiting Singapore.","Green,Centrally Located",,,484,64,100
Fragrance Hotel - Oasis,3.5,360 reviews,#172 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Wifi,English,"Share, ,Fragrance (Oasis) has given me a very pleasant stay and made me felt I have made the wise choice in choosing it to be my accommodation. Rates were very good too !   Room were clean and well equipped for daily stay. Aircon is good with strong water pressure hot showers.   The reception personnel have made me felt at home every time when I return to the hotel.   Very very convenient location too with a bus stop just right beside the entrance that provide buses to various locations in SG. Superb !   I will only return to Fragrance Oasis in future and recommend others to consider Fragrance Oasis !,This is the 3rd times I booked Fragrance Oasis. It's a good alternative who need a clean & comfort place to stay with low budget. Bus stop is just in front of the door which make us easy to travel anywhere. Excelent!,I spent two nights as a single at this hotel and had a wonderful experience. Marc at the front desk helped with directions, bus routes, airport transportation, and dining suggestions.  He could not have been more helpful. The location is great for public transportation and nearby activities.   As a single traveler the room was safe, clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again if I ever return to Singapore. ,Easily located. Bus stop nearby. Thank you staff Shanti for your help. All other staffs were very helpful as well. Managed to go around and visit places. Balestier is amazing. Restaurants and shopping mart nearby.,I have all reasons to recommend Fragrance Oasis as once of the best budget hotel at Singapore   There’s a bus station directly in front of the hotel entrance. Novena MRT is approx 15mins stay away   In terms of food choices, Balestier foodcourt is immediately beside the hotel   The rooms and toilet are indeed small but this is really what you can expect with the budget price tag. Rooms are nevertheless clean and the bed is comfortable   Overall a pretty good stay and definitely a good choice for budget travellers ","Budget,Quiet",4617,ZenHotels.com,62,7,81
Orchard Point Serviced Apartments,3.5,276 reviews,#83 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Electric vehicle charging station,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,In short it was not pleasant stay, in a spacious suite with old furnitures surrounded by noises. We could not sleep because of noises and lights. We had booked 14 nights, but moved out after the first night as we could not meet our family member travelling to Singapore from the USA, due to the last minute change in travel restrictions by Singapore government. We asked for partial refund as we spent just one night, but were refused. Without compassion and empathy as well as friendly environment the apartments will no longer be my recommendation list. Penny wise, Pound foolish! ,Very professional and excellent service. Trying to accommodate our situation when we are extended our stay while we were all out that day with our busy schedule. Request was response in timely manner.,Stayed in the studio apartment with my wife and 5 yr old kid. Very good service by the management and they had stocked enough items including bed linen, garbage bags for the whole SHN stay since no one else allowed to enter the room and we cannot go out.  Lots of food options available nearby as this apartment is located in Orchard road. Price is little high but you will not regret.  P.S - They provide rice cooker too so you can prepare a light meal for yourself.,Staff were very friendly, helpful and accomodating.  Place is well maintained.  Toiletries were provided.  Location is very convenient for eating and shopping and transport.  Price is reasonable.  I was quite happy staying at OPSA.,Michael, Mardy and Kath are very accomodating in all what we need in the serviced apartment.  Be it for cleanliness and comfort purposes or even listen to our struggle of keep extending due to alot of unexpected hurdles during our renovation period.   Not only that, very generous in providing toiletries and excellent cleaning service.   It is a one stop stay that is convenient to find food and our necessity. A step away to Orchard street and malls that I love to visit.   I definitely will come back for the genuine, friendly services and their professionalism.   Do reach out to these 3 great individuals and experience yourself what I have written above.   Cheers and Stay Safe to all. Be well as all will be well.","Centrally Located,Mid-range",,,439,64,100
Gallop Hill Top Resort,4.0,3 reviews,#22 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,,,"Share, ,free WIFI,orchard road,fast & free wifi,free wifi,Singapore Botanic Gardens,free wifi,Singapore Botanic Gardens,It's been a long time since we've had a true country holiday, and while Singapore can't offer that, Gallop Hilltop Resort is the next best thing. We booked two rooms for three night for us and our daughter, and enjoyed a relaxed staycation in a location that was far more rural than the Singapore we're used to. The rooms are small and basic, but that's reflected in the price. They're comfortable and nicely decorated, and the rustic feel of the the hotel was exactly what we were looking for. The grounds are nice, the pool great fun, the riding excellent and Horsecity has a good set of restaurants - a good place to spend a few days. In short, if you're looking for a very relaxing, reasonably priced holiday, I can happily recommend this hotel.,Food tastes very good as we were served with BBQ and breakfast. However, service was a bit slow as food was served a bit late and hordes came late. Room is decent and the horse riding staff is friendly... ,Stayed there for night for a boys night out.  Though the amenities n facilities are very basic, its a great choice if ur looking for a place to stay n party.   Pool was good enough for us to play captains ball.  Bbq area available where u can have grilled food.  Ample space available by the pool to relax play your music, dance n eat.  Being surrounded by nature some insects or mosquitoes may be expected but guess some repellent will fo the trick.   Rooms are small. Would have been better if they were any bigger. But they were clean. The bedding was very comfy. Front desk guy Daniel assisted us to bring in food from cavern restaurant n bar which is just down the hill.   Cavern restaurant n bar is just a minute from the hotel. Great food n drinks are available there. On weekends, its party time where u can expect a big crowd.   I would say this is the place to stay if u love to have outdoor party n stay close to nature.   Overall had a pleasant stay n a great party time.,…",,,,60,9,67
Arcadia Hotel,4.0,124 reviews,#145 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Hindi, Malay","Share, ,My wife and I had a lovely stay at the Arcadia in March 2016. The decor is tastefully done, and the rooms are well furnished. One of the things that stood out for me was the attention to detail. For a boutique hotel, a lot of thought went into the elements of each room. The toiletries supplied were of a luxurious quality, and the coffee machine and choice coffee and tea were a nice surprise.  What really stood out for me, however, was the service. Charles and Randy, who run the hotel, are extremely helpful, and do their best to ensure their guests have the best experience possible. Charles pays careful attention to his guests' needs, and always makes you feel you're well taken care of. He also makes sure your breakfast is served piping hot, and done the way you like it!   My, experience at the Arcadia has left me with a smile and fond memories, and I'm looking forward to the next time I'll be back. Oh yeah, try the pancakes Charles makes -- it's crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. Perfect with butter and maple syrup!,…,We have just returned from 3 nights at the Arcadia Hotel prior to a 5 night cruise from Singapore.  The hotel is small, friendly and very well located for people wishing to spend time in Singapores interesting little districts rather than the City.  Arcadia has great staff who made us very comfortable and welcome. The breakfast is served on the ground floor near reception and is very high quality with beautiful presentation and value for money.  If you want to venture out everything is really close and we never needed a taxi or other transport during our stay until we were ready for the cruise terminal.  Something to note about the hotel is that most rooms have no windows as the hotel is low level and situated in a nice back street just off the Lavender main road, this was quite, a shock and took some getting used to so worth considering if you are staying for a while. We didn't mind too much but it is a bit strange. However the hotel is small, modern and very clean and there is a small roof garden on the top which has nice fresh air before bed and limited views of the area.  The local area is very well served for amenities with a 7-11 supermarket, several quality restaurants very close. Anything you want is walking distance. For example at the end of the street and turn left there is a wonderful sports facility with soccer stadium, public swimming pools etc available at very reasonable prices.   A gentle half hour stroll will take you towards Little India District with fabulous malls and the legendary Mustafa Mall which sells literally every possible item you could want and its open 24/7 including Sunday so it really never closes.  Little India has great tourist shops and restaurants plus its really interesting to visit and people watch.  If you want to eat out we used Broadway food court at the end of Hamilton Road just minutes from the hotel. It was convenient and popular with locals and businesses people and again is wonderful for cheap quality food and people spotting.  We would highly recommend Arcadia for a stay and will consider it should we return to Singapore in future.  It's about half an hour by taxi from the airport and very close by taxi to the cruise terminal both options are very reasonably priced. ,…,I had a horrible experience at this extremely tiny hotel. Not a place I will stay again at. The room had no windows, it was very tight and small. It was clean though. There is room service or a kitchen that can cater for late night snack in case you check in late.,The hotel is located in the Lavender neighbourhood. The rooms are small but modern and in good condition. The staff s very friendly and helpful. Even though we arrived very early and had expected that we would only be able to store our suitcases there, we were able to get our room immediately without any extra fee. On our second stay, we were upgraded to a larger room, again free of charge.  Be aware that the rooms are small and most f them have no windows – that's Singapore. If you want a sacious room with a view, be prepared to pay for it. If you want a clean and modern place to sleep, this hotel is for you.  The L'Occitane toiletries provided are a nice touch, as is the capsule coffee maker (not in all rooms).,Rooms are small but very clean and comfortable for few nights' stay. Recommended for those who are keen to explore, especially for those who like to explore by foot - some of these cafes and food stalls can be easily reached by foot.  Surrounding the hotel are several decent hipster cafes that are worth a visit -  Chye Seng Huat Hardware - just 1 street away (recommended for coffee, chocolates & some have their breakfast / brunch) Kilo Kallang - nearer to Lavender station AEIOU - 2 streets away from Chye Seng Huat Enchanted, Old Hen Coffee Bar (recommended) - these cafes are about 2 to 3km away. If you don't mind walking, it'll only take you 10-15mins by foot or hop onto the train from Lavender station and get to Farrer Park station.  There are quite a local food stalls around, the hotel. If you are not that picky, there are restaurants and a food court just a few streets away. If you like to walk, navigate your way to Jalan Besar where you can find a lot of local eateries and the market filled with food stalls. Some are open until late. There are several more eateries along the route to Lavender station as well including Tim Ho Wan (for some Hong Kong dim sum) McDonald's, Toast Box (local breakfast / tea-time spot) where you get local coffee, eggs and toast.  There is also a Fair Price grocer along the route back to the hotel from Lavender station.,…",,,,174,17,92

The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel,4.5,"1,394 reviews",#19 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,The concept of The POD is to offer travellers the service of a boutique hotel, combined with upscale hostel accommodation at a reasonable price (for Singapore standards) and in my opinion this concept works for a city like Singapore, where accommodation is rather expensive.   I have stayed for over 2 months at this boutique capsule hotel, because of a professional transition in Singapore and would describe my experience as follows:  THE GOOD:  •  The location   Situated in the Arab quarter of Singapore (Kampong Glam) with lots of restaurants and cute bars (the quirky and very hip Haji Lane is just a minute walk from The POD) and about 8 minutes walk from Bugis MRT (if you like walking, you can also walk to Little India in about 15 minutes).  The area is very safe (but so is, Singapore in general).     From Bugis MRT you can take a direct train to the airport (takes about 30 minutes). If you leave from the MRT station Nicoll Highway (about 8 minutes walk from the hotel.  When you get out of the hotel, turn left and keep on walking until you get to the sheltered overhead bridge. Go up and keep on walking until you reach the MRT station), the train takes you straight to the Botanical Garden (beautiful and very relaxing).  •  The boutique style character     The lobby/common area felt very homely and modern.   There was a fridge to store your food, all day complimentary coffee/tea, use of a microwave, television (although the area was not really made to chill out in front of the TV, if that is what you are after.   It was ok to watch the news or to listen to some music in the morning and then you were gone for the day (which most people did).  •  The 24 hours reception and staff  The receptionists were very helpful and friendly, although I think it would help if they would be a bit more consistent in explaining The POD rules to arriving guests .  More than once people arrived in the middle of the night and switched on the lights, which could have been avoided if the rules were made clear from the beginning (to use their pod individual lights after 11 pm).    Rismin, who used to be a Concierge at the Inter-Continental hotel in Singapore always had some good recommendations.  Ask him about hidden treasures in Singapore and he will know about them.  •  The cleanliness of The POD   The young ladies from Housekeeping were going around throughout the day to make sure the bathrooms and toilets were clean.    They worked seriously hard so all of us were comfortable.  Thank you very much for that !  •  The bathrooms  There were three proper bathrooms (very much like standard hotel bathrooms) on each floor and 2 separate toilets (although the bathrooms had ensuite toilets too) and if you avoid the “rush hour” (usually between 08.00-09.00 am) you should not have to wait at all and if you do, just go to another floor and use the bathrooms there.  There were hairdryers and an ironing board and iron on each floor to use as well.  •  The comfort of the capsule    Every capsule had a separate light switch, a three pin power socket, a hanger and a fold up table.   Towels were changed daily and bed sheets every 3rd day if I remember well.   The beds were very comfortable.    If you are a little on the “claustrophobic” side, you might feel in the “front entry pods” a bit like lying in an oversized “coffin” (minus the disadvantage of being dead), therefore I would suggest you go for the side entry pods.      The capsules all have blinds, which can be pulled down, however, if you have your light switched on inside, people can still see you through the blinds.    It was not an issue for me, but I just mention it for those who expect full privacy.    There was a safe for each pod under the bed (not large enough for a big suitcase, but I had my large suitcase outside and open all the time and it was safe and for all your other valuables, you use the safe).   Shoes were not allowed in the dorms and corridors and this was respected by everybody.   In front of the dorms each pod had a safe to store the shoes.  •  Comfort in the ladies only dorm (excluding the rustling of plastic bags)     During my stay I had to change the dorms three times and would say the following. If you are a lady, booking a pod in the ladies dorm is probably one of the best options, because this dorm was larger than the others I had stayed in, there was an area where you could change, a sofa and a lot of space to just store your suitcase in front of your pod.   And a huge advantage was, that not once in that dorm I had to go through a night of anybody snoring and that was already a blessing.      I also stayed in a mixed dorm on the third floor (that was the floor where the reception and common area were situated and in my opinion also the floor with the least waiting times for the showers) and thought that it was not bad at all. There were single and double pods and staying in a mixed dorm was NEVER an issue, everybody was very conscious that we all lacked privacy and therefore behaved very discreetly.  I would recommend those dorms, even to female solo travellers.  Then I also stayed in a mixed dorm with only 5 pods (side entry) on the third floor and having 5 pods also meant less people moving around, BUT the dorm was small and there was hardly any space to leave a suitcase in the corridor without making it difficult for people to move around.  I liked my very private pod in the corner and no bed on top of mine, but it seemed there were always more men than women in that dorm, which was of course not an issue, except that the chances of men snoring were much higher than women snoring and I had some pretty nerve wracking nights in there (ear plugs did not help).    •  The 2 business cubicles in the lobby                                                              I had previously stayed in another capsule hostel in Singapore called ""Vintage Inn"" (I had written a post about it, check it out and this hostel was also not bad at all, but not as stylish as The POD) and the only reason why I left, was due to the fact, that there was no private space to make phone/skype calls and since I was working, I needed that privacy occasionally. The POD had two business cubicles in the lobby and there was a phone (local calls free of charge) and a laptop for free use.  You could close the door and work from there in privacy (it was often very chilly in there, but ask the receptionists and they will turn up the temperature).  •  The added value benefits                                                                                                                   You are entitled to one free item of dry cleaning per day (leave it in the morning and you get it back the next day), you get a bottle of water per day, local phone calls are complimentary, free use of the washing machine (and powder) and dryer (you often pay for that in other hostels so keep in mind that this value is really good).   The two washing machines and dryers were on the 5th floor.  Pick a not so busy time (either very early morning or nights or sometime during the day) to avoid waiting times.    •  The mix  of guests  Business travellers would be the last who spring to mind when you think about a hostel, but there were actually quite a number of them.   Mostly chilled people on business, either in and out of Singapore for projects and not liking the anonymity of a hotel and coming to an empty hotel room in the evening.  Most people I would say though, were on leisure, there were solo travellers, groups, couples, older and younger people, but I have not come across the party backpacker crowd (I think the price range of this capsule hotel will not attract them), therefore do not fear drinking and partying in your dorms (drinking and eating is not allowed in the dorms anyway), it is very unlikely to happen and in general there was never much talking in the dorms either.   THE NOT SO GOOD  •  Quality of sleep  I cannot recall that I once slept through the night without waking up (if you get 5 hours continuous sleep count yourself lucky unless you are the kind of person who even sleeps through an earthquake).  Don’t get me wrong, I know it was a dorm and people had different arrival/departure patterns and itineraries and we needed to move, open doors, lockers, etc. and a certain tolerance is needed when you opt for this kind of accommodation, but a lot of travellers showed a real lack of consideration for other people in the dorm, notably in the female only dorm.  It was clearly mentioned that lights should be switched off at 11.00 pm and people should use their individual pod lights or torches provided by the reception, but this was ignored many times and especially the very young women spent hours !, packing, un-packing, re-packing their suitcases in the evening and if you ever had to listen to rustling plastic bags for hours, you know what I mean.  I had to remind them more than once to either stop or to carry on packing their luggage outside the dorm and in general they were very apologetic.   Same in the morning, many people got up very early by 06.30 am, slammed doors, packed and re-packed their suitcases, rustled with their plastic bags and often lights went on as well.  Not an issue for myself, I got up early as well, but I felt really sorry for those guests who still slept (or tried to).       On a positive note, there was in general very little talking going on in the dorm (even during the day), but that was probably also due to the fact that all the pods were single ones and people do not tend to talk to themselves when they travel alone, but get a bunch of girls together, that is a whole different story.  You open the door of the dorm with a magnetic key card and the constant opening and closing of doors was very noisy (not the fault of the hotel, but there are hostels that overcome that problem, see the Vintage Inn and it makes a big difference) and you are bound to wake up with people coming and going all the time.  My friendly advice to the receptionists, be more consistent in your explanations when you welcome guests.   They should be clearly explained that lights will be switched off at 11.00 pm and should they need to pack their suitcases for a longer period very early morning or after 11 pm, they should please do so outside the dorm or pack during the day time.  It is a boutique hostel and not a classic hotel after all and I am sure guests will understand if you explain the rules to them clearly or maybe even adding a ""The Pod hotel etiquette"" section on the website (if they don’t understand, then this type of accommodation is simply not for them).  It would also help, if the night receptionist would go around the dorms himself and switches off the lights at 11 pm . Considering that The Pod in my opinion also targets the “chilled” business traveller, this point is even more valid, because those guests have to work the next day and do not have the luxury of taking cat naps during the day to catch up on some sleep.   •  The Dining area  If the hotel is running at full capacity (in my opinion well before that) you will not find the breakfast seating a pleasant or relaxing experience.  There was definitely not enough space and people had to sit around the buffet table most of the time due to a lack of space and seats around the table.  Maybe this is all good for encouraging communication among people (although from my experience at that time of the day not everybody was really keen on a talk), but it surely was not an ideal seating. I would not know what the hotel could do differently, because the space was what it was, so just be prepared and come at times when it is still relatively quiet (either very early like 07.30 or rather later at 09.45-10.00 am).  THE BETWEEN THE GOOD AND NOT SO GOOD   •  The breakfast  Do not get me wrong, having a breakfast like at The POD was not what I had expected and it was a rather pleasant surprise. However, if you try to eat a breakfast which does not include 5000 calories and a sugar load that gives you diabetes II during your stay, you were hard-pressed to find healthy options on the buffet (apart from the milk and sometimes some fruit).  Most food was either sugar loaded pastries or cereals and a lot of fried food.   If you like this kind of food for breakfast, good for you, but for those who expect a few healthy options, you might be a bit disappointed.  But overall, much better than I had expected and if you are not happy, go over to the supermarket and buy a few items that suit your taste.  As you see my, “The good” list is far longer than the “The not so good"" list (although the lack of sleep quality rates high !) and overall I would highly recommend The Pod and I will definitely come back when staying in Singapore.    Would I come back for another 2 months stay, especially when on business ?  Probably not, but only because the constant lack of quality sleep took its toll and tolerance levels decreased with every week that passed and I would probably opt for a “stay with a host"" option through websites like Airbnb, Flipkeys, etc. for a longer stay.  Here a few more tips for you travellers  •  If you do freelance work and need to work during your stay, but want to get out of your capsule, go to the National Library of Singapore (a 10 minutes walk from The POD) to the 5th floor.  There is a study room, which mostly students use.    Bright window front, sufficient space (but go early if you need a place with a power plug, because it can get busy), a courtyard where you can relax, free internet access and it is open from 09.00 – 09.00 pm every day (except public holidays). It was the perfect home office !.   Loved it.  Thanks to Rismin at The POD who recommended it to me.  •  If you like running, go out of The POD turn left and walk about 200 metres, cross the sheltered overhead bridge to the other side and you reach Kallang River (not more than a 5 minutes walk).  You can run for about 10 km (or shorter if you wish) all around the river, passing by many of the sights, like Marina Bay, the Merlion, Garden by the Bay, Esplanade).  It is a beautiful run along the bay, very early morning or by night when Singapore shines in beautiful lights.     •  If you need a supermarket, there is a Cold Storage at Bugis, although when I happened to be in the area of Little India I always went to “The Verge” to Sheng Siong supermarket in the basement which was less expensive than Cold Storage (you find them in most malls in the basement, but they will be your most expensive option for products you find elsewhere for less).  Close to the Bugis MRT, you also find a Fair Price supermarket (the choice of many locals who surely shop smarter than most tourists), also more reasonable priced than Cold Storage.  Opposite the Verge in Little India you have the Tikka Centre for some good indian hawker food (ok, don’t go for a romantic dinner, it is not a beautiful hawker place, just go for some good indian street/comfort food). And while you are on that road, you might as well make your way to Mustafa Centre, an indian department store (but it caters of course not only to the indian taste) which is open 24/7. This place is huge and I think you can stay for a whole week in there and still would not finish seeing everything.  Avoid Sundays, the worst day to go (also for shopping in Little India).   It seemed all indian workers and residents of Little India spent their Sundays in Little India and Mustafa Centre, it was always jam packed everywhere.     •  If you come from the airport to go to The Pod, there is an airport shuttle counter at the arrival hall. Just mention where you want to go, pay SGD 9 and they drop you off at your hotel (they take several people to drop them off at their respective hotels).  You can also take the train from the airport MRT station which takes you straight to Bugis MRT and it will probably cost no more than SGD 2.50, but I am not sure if you want to schlep your heavy suitcase from the MRT to the hotel. It is not too far, but loaded with luggage not really comfortable, so better to spend a few pounds more on the shuttle.   Taxi I think is around SGD 30 depending on the time of the day.  •  If in Singapore and you use the MRT (local subway), buy an ENZ card (at any MRT station) for SGD 12 which includes a SGD 5 non-refundable fee for the card and a credit of SGD 7.  You can top up this card whenever needed and it works out much cheaper than buying single tickets every time.  No photo is needed to buy the ENZ card.  •  Opposite The POD hotel (in front of the Park Royal hotel, just walk over the sheltered overhead bridge when you get out of The Pod), you find a bus stop and from there (it is bus no.100) you can get to Harbourfront to go over to Sentosa (Universal Studios and the beaches.  You also find one of Singapore's biggest malls ""Vivo"" there). Very practical and faster than going by MRT and you can use your ENZ card too on the busses.   •  I also highly recommend the Singapore Zoo  (ticket price SGD 32 per adult, SGD 21 per child and if you want to use the tram as well, add another SGD 5. Check their packages though if you want to combine the zoo with the river cruise or night safari, it comes cheaper and The POD I believe is selling those tickets at a lower rate too), nothing beats an animal in the wild, but the Singapore zoo has made a real effort for the animals in the zoo and there is a lot of education about animal protection.   An absolutely stunning zoo. There are several restaurants, but you can also bring your own food and there is a small picnic area.  •  Head over to the Art Museum of Singapore on Fridays.  Free entrance from 6 pm to 9 pm  •  Get a local SIM card, because your roaming costs could be very high. There is an M1 (one of Singapore’s telecom providers) counter in the arrival hall at the airport.   I paid SGD 30 for one month (the SunSurf Plan) and have not even used half of the credit.   The card was a life saver, because I could use the internet all the time from my smartphone and that was definitely needed for my GPS to guide me around Singapore.   The GPS will also come in very handy when you decide to take the bus, because unlike in the MRT there is no bus stop name announcement, so if you don’t know your station, you are lost.  With the GPS I just typed in my destination and counted the bus stops.      Alternatively ask the bus driver to let you know when you reach your stop.,…,I stayed here for 3 nights during March.  Took a bus from the airport, got off at shaw bld and walks for about 5 minutes towards brussorah street, you'll see 5stones hostel first but walk pass it and a shop called rule of thumb and you'll find a locked door with keypad; that's your stop. The hostel occupy the 3rd-5th floor of the building. Lobby is on 3rd floor. There's a space to leave your luggage (before checkin/after checkout) but the common area itself is really small that I end up skipping their breakfast because I don't want to rush for seats. The bed itself was okay. Nothing too fascinating. The blind was not opaque. People will still be able to see what you did in your pod (whether your in the upper or lower pod) on the other hand it's you couldn't really see the, outside. The bed has lockable space underneath the lower pod and it activates with your keycard(this is for everything from entering the main door to your own room and for this locker). It sounds cool in theory but the truth is it's so annoyingly loud. The locker space itself was more than sufficient but it make getting on and off lower bunk a bit more inconvenient cuz my legs just really cant reach the floor in one go so I was kinda leaping on and off.  Not to mention everyone I talked to including me has agreed that the upper bunks are really hard to climb. Maybe it's the ladder placement problem or smth. But we all agree on that. If you sleep near the door you will hear people going in and out. If you sleep near the window you will hear the traffic outside and sometimes conversations from the next room. Your choice.  The guests are also kind of loud. I have a group of korean girls goggling into the night(like until 1am) and woke up with their morning chitchats. There was also a girl who talks ob the phone at a loud voice until late. No one cares for the turn off lights after 11pm rules too. So you either enforce it or lift it.  There're shower room and toilets on every floor including on lobby floor which also has dorm rooms as i have found out later. But for some reasons people will always flocked to shower at the same time. You can use other floor's shower room but I always had to wait in some way even with climbing to check ones from other floors. (This never happens to me when I was in Japan and the shower room to bed ratio was worse. I dunno why) also, a lot of shower seems to have broken in some way. I was in a room where the shower head was leaking and another room has broken shower head hanger.  Another thing I'd like to note is when you're entering your floor you are to take your shoes off. But every one either wear their shoes anyway or with slippers that they also used to walk outside . You Should be more clear on what your policy is and enforce them cuz tbh I don't feel clean walking to your bathrooms barefeet so I end up wearing flipflops everywhere too.  The food for breakfast was simple. You got some pastries and dimsums. Coffee, tea, horlicks. Nothing that taste especially good to mention and with the fact that there's really limited seats, Might as well take the bus from opposite the hostel and go look out for food elsewhere.  When I book this hostel I had requested to be put away from the door and preferably on the lower bunk, when I arrived I was not offered both - which was fine by me - I completely understand that it was due to availability until I find out my bunk also had unlockable locker because the frontdesk at the time said the previous customer broke them. To be honest I wouldn't have minded as much if everyone has the same unlockable locker or if I have a friend travelling with me and she has a working one. I survived putting my ipad in my unlockable drawer in japan. I couldn't have cared less. But the fact that I have requests that unfortunately they cannot fullfill yet they would put me, a solo customer with requests into a broken pod and  made really bad first impression. To me, it's like you've booked a hotel and your room door cannot be locked but front said everything's okay but if you have valuables just leave it with us. Not to mention that the first staff only smiled and say there's nothing I can do (not even try) but the guy from the nightshift was so willing to help. Furthermore, after I press that you gotta give me something. I didnot get what I have requested; At least give me a lockable functioning locker. I am not pleases that I paid full amount but I got an malfunctioned bed.  I managed to get moved to both what I requested and a functioning locker when you said just the day before that ever customer was locked in place there's nothing I can do.  Then what were you doing all this time? Not to mention they said they would relocate my bags to my new pod for me but they didn't. I don't mind moving my own luggage. This is not raffles hotel. And I sure have dragged a luggage with a weight of a primary school kid on my own before.  But if you said you would, you should. They should realised that people who take time to request for smth has higher expectations.  I really doubt their staffs training. And yes I am fully aware this is a hostel not a hotel.  Personally, except from the fact that this hostel was decorated in a more fancy manner, I don't think it has any superiority to your usual bunk bed hostel. Plus, when you've been shopping and walking all day, you still need to walk another 10 minutes from the mrt station to this hostel.  Not coming back. Probably better off staying at bunk bed hostels with more strategic locations or I'll just stay at my usual hotel.,…,Nice cozy budget accommodation conveniently located within the city. Walking distance to heritage site with local eatery, restaurants, bars and shops. A 15mins walk will take you to one of the major shopping mall and subway station. Hotel is located along the main road with public bus transport right in front.  Breakfast is inclusive and selection is reasonable. There are sufficient rest and shower room to cater for their guest and a common vanity area is a good feature where other cubicle hotel does not have. Overall, an unique staying experience with comfortable sleep at a very reasonable price.. ,I stayed 2 nights there in the single pod side entry.  It was the best hostel I ever stayed at. And I did travel ! Why ? - good air con in the room - comfy bed, 2 pillows ! No noise when you turn around in your bed  - automatic atmosphere smell machin in the room. The smell was very nice. Loved it ! - bathroom is huge. You have your own little bathroom when you shower. Like with shower, toilet and a sink. So you can change, brush your teeth with confort. And it even look pretty nice and well decorated.  - the kind of curtain they use is really good. Perfect for privacy.  - breakfast is included and good.  - bottle of water is given when you arrive and you have a free refill at the reception - people working at the reception are very nice and friendly.  - at 11pm someone come and, turn off the main light of the room.   I spend 3 nights in Singapore. 2 nights at the Pod and one night at the Marina Bay Hotel. I regret my choice to stay at Marina Bay. Over priced and not as good as The Pod. So imagine ! ,…,The courtesy of the staff will really make you feel you're at home. Though the capsules themselves need a little adjustment in terms of size, our overall stay is comfortable.   Breakfast is good and healthy, and the comfort rooms are clean.   Will definitely go back!",Modern,,,403,72,99
Fairmont Singapore,4.5,"8,409 reviews",#67 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,Booked a 1 night Spacation which comes with an 1 hour massage and breakfast for 2, $150 credit and a complimentary parking during stay.  Their response through email was fast and my request for early checkin/out was granted.  Checking in/out was smooth and fast by doing online using the pre-arrival form which they will email out 48hrs before checking in. Due to Covid, it is advisable to booked the facilities such as pool, gym, wet spa in advance through the pre-arrival form.   Bed was too soft for our liking othewise the room and it cleanness was perfect. Handheld nor toilet seat bidet spray was not available in the room I stay which was a let down consider this is a 5-stars hotel.,Really well appointed room with impressive smart features. Love the attention to detail. The design and materials of everything from the dark paneled/ herringbone fabric walls to the furnishings and bathroom are tasteful and classy. The smart features controlled by panels around the room draw and close the curtains, allow you to switch between “work” and softer lighting. Charging ports and panels are placed thoughtfully around the room. Motion sensors accurately sense when you get off the bed and head to the bathroom when it is dark. Oh and when I first arrived, the curtains drew themselves and revealed the fantastic view! I’m really tall, so the deep and long bathtub was a rare treat for me.  Apart from all that, the staff are great,called in every few days to check on me,, brought everything I ordered for delivery promptly.   Will definitely come consider coming back with family next time I’m back in Singapore.,…,I'm an AccorPlus member, and my online reservations were excellent and my online check-in experience was trouble-free. Physical check in experience was a breeze .... tended to by a single Fairmont staff ( James ) . No trouble at all. Fairmont arranged for adjoining rooms according to my request. The rooms were very comfortable with a balcony and CtyView of Raffles Hotel/Beach Road facing i.e. morning sun facing.  What really made this staycation special was the $100/night/room dining benefit at Fairmont/Swissotel ( Accor )  ..... and the breakfast arrangements @ Prego ( reservations with pre-orders placed ..... 45 mins allocation per table for breakfast. We loved the breakfast menu/options.  Highly recommended to family & friends.,Stayed in Fairmont, from 16-18 March 2021. Seamless check-in at the counter and Jasmine from reception provided helpful information for our stay. E.g. booking of facilities and breakfast timeslot at Prego as well as operating hours. Thanks for the great assistance.   Safe management measures were not disruptive to our itinerary, needs and wants.   Room was superb, nice view, quiet and spacious. See the photos!   Really stuffed ourselves with food using our dining credits, as well as complimentary breakfast. Location is together with Raffles City Shopping Centre for more food and shopping.  Parking by fairmont is also hassle-free as the gantry records the IU after the first exit using the complimentary season ticket (duration of the stay).,The service is excellent here. The staff are so accommodating and so responsive. The room is very spacious and I love the sleek design of it. The view of the city is also really beautiful from my room. I love the sustainable features such as the in-room water dispenser which allows me to enjoy my stay without feeling too guilty about hurting the environment. On the 7th day during my quarantine, they even sent a special dessert to my room to congratulate me for being halfway through my quarantine. Which is so thoughtful of them.","Green,Family",17949,Fairmont,450,75,100
VIP Hotel,3.5,123 reviews,#216 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,Hair dryer was not working when I tried to use it at night, called the recep and a Chinese aunty picked up the phone. She could not offer a solution until I asked if they have a portable hair dryer for me to use instead. I asked if someone would bring it to the room for me, however she said the hotel guest have to go down to pick it up themselves, because she’s the only one at the recep, and that her colleague has just gone to check on another room. I told her it’s ok, when her colleague returns can I kindly request that they have someone send the hair dryer up to me.  However, she got irritated and then said that staff cannot go to guest’s room at night, it’s hotel policy. I asked which policy number is this, because I have not heard it before, and moreover she just told me her, COLLEAGUE JUST WENT UP TO CHECK ON A GUEST’S ROOM! She gave me very contradictory information. She then got even more irritated then finally explained that female staff are not supposed to go to guests rooms at night. Very odd because I am female, and she doesn’t need to come inside my room, just have to pass the hair dryer. Before I could say anything, she slammed the phone down. Can VIP hotel please explain this policy? It almost sounds to me, god forbid, that she was too lazy to handle hotel guests’ problems.  I think the same staff is the one people have been leaving horrible reviews about, the hotel should check on the attitude and professioalism of those staff. Terrible service coming from this one staff.  On the other hand, I would like to compliment a male malay staff who was extremely polite and professional during my check in at 4pm. There was some mix up of bookings but he came to my room to apologise about the mix up and also fixed the bath tub for me when the water wouldn’t drain.,…,Stayed in the 3rd floor and all was well just that all is ol school. Carpark is free. We book for swimming at 4pm and kids speaks louder and playful. The pool has echo and the sound will be louder. We was approach by the staff to lower volume which is in unprofessional way. The pool has echo you cant blame and also we have kids how to control? Smokers can smoke outside so not very family friendly. Will never return.✌,Hi, we stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms are spacious but extremely outdated. Bathroom leaking, no USB portals. In the pool towels not offered, bring you’re own from the room ;). Breakfast extremely limited to eggs and bread and cereal. Restroom on the first floor is out of order which means ( after you ask the staff) requires a special key. We ate breakfast outside but the table wasn’t ever wiped.  Lots of potential no management. ,Booked a room here for 2 nights for am overseas associate just coz its near my home. Rooms are fairly large. Decor is fairly dated. Not that it is a big deal. Comfortable and quiet as it is located in the Balmoral estate. Front desk service is warm and accomodative. No complaints from my guest.,I stayed there for a week with family in October. Listing pros and cons: Pros: Rare mid budget hotel with spacious room Comfortable beds, daily housekeeping Quiet and cosy. 10mins walk to 7-11, and other eating options Cons: Breakfast, its the same every single day and is below average. Tastes poor, Even after requesting change or variety, they didn't do anything. Wouldn't describe staff and management as very friendly. I had booked through Agoda which said child stays free if no extra bedding taken but the hotel didn't listen and made me pay extra. They are not accomodating and lack patience , they bugged me each time I passed by the reception till I didn't pay extra although I had paid 100%advance to Agoda. They will not serve breakfast if you are just a couple of minutes late, even in low occupancy. As it is you get tired of same rancid noodles, sausages and beans every single day! They say free shuttle service but the driver is never available (free). In my 7days, I could never use it. Got 5 reminder calls to vacate the room by 12, I am just thankful they agreed to keep our luggage as we had next day early morning flight. I would recommend a stay here only if you are okay with above. Don't go looking for anything  Special, they don't really make you feel like a guest.  ,…","Residential Neighbourhood,Quiet",,,26,4,68

My 21days wouldnt be that great without you all. Excellent job.,Special thanks to Ernest from the sales team and Hidayah the DM for the arrangement, enjoy the meal and the extension for the checking out, just too bad as the sauna wasn't open during the period of our visit,Love the kind gesture to send a little surprise to my child via Jena. My child was super surprised and happy as this is the first time his visit to Hotel Jen!  The room (1307) has a fallen usb plug at the bedside near the window which was not fixed when reported.,We stayed for 2 nights in total. The hotel staff are all very friendly, attentive and professional. The overall experience was very good - only slightly marred by the ongoing roadworks, renovations and detours around the hotel vicinity. Also, the included breakfast buffet could be better if more choices and variety are present.","Family,City View",12325,FindHotel,65,14,97

I checked in to a very serious-looking receptionist. He just asked for my payment and gave me my key. Although the older lady at the reception smiled at me, they did not offer to help me with my three bags.   My room was small but very very clean. I got two single beds and a big tv. The bathroom was very modern and clean too but surprisingly, there was no bidet.   The wifi password is conveniently placed on the tv and I automatically input the password on my phone and ipad.   There is no included breakfast with my room and I did not ask if they have a restaurant in the hotel. The price of SG$100 was too high for this type of room, but since everything is more expensive in Singapore, this is the budget range.  , What I don’t like about this hotel is that some clients were very noisy at night that I had to put on headphones in order to sleep. I found out that this hotel is also near Singapore’s red district. I just wish the management at least notify the noisy clients that they are disturbing other people in the hotel. ,…,Pros:  - nice and clean room with hot/cold shower (our room was facing the soccer field and    has a nice view of the open area) - near small restaurants and small groceries. - 24/7 reception - affordable price for couples (queen size double bed) - fast WiFi, double lock, big flat screen TV - have toiletries such as: tissue, toothbrush with small toothpaste and 2 in 1    shampoo/soap liquid  - have small electric kettle with 2 water bottles, 2 instant coffee and 2 instant tea - have hair dryer, refrigerator, safe, 2 USB ports for charging and 2 3-pronged socket  Cons: - the hotel is situated around the red light district - on the 3rd day there were small drain flies at the ceiling of the comfort room (well    they just stayed on the ceiling just think of it as black paint, splatter) - not much channel to choose from...most are Chinese channels.,…,The Hotel 81 chain in general is just a touch above the Hostels in Singapore (Some hostels are also better)  They just exist.  I booked them as I was attending the concerts in the Singapore Indoor Stadium.   The rooms aren't the most clean, you wont find more than 10 functioning channels. Water can sometimes be extremely hot or extremely cold   But if you have a concert or an event to attend, these are your best options as it is walking distance to MRT and the Stadium",,,,52,6,74
InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay,4.5,745 reviews,#21 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),Malay,"Share, ,InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay is a design hotel with very cool design feautres.   Standard rooms are small but very well planned with sliding doors for better privacy.  Nice pool, but for being European a bit too much in the shade. However, nice sunbathing  in the afternoon.  Shopping, restaurants in the neighborhood. About 10-15 minues beautiful walk along the quay to Marina Bay.  I would not mind staying here again.,Had a 2 nights staycation with family, the connecting corner rooms were excellent with lots of privacy!  All the staff we met along the corridor, lobby and restaurant were cheerful and friendly. Only area to improve is perhaps we should have been informed during check-in that there is no daily making up of rooms. Nevertheless, Housekeeping came to throw thrash and change towels when we requested for the service. ,I am just so impressed with the service given at Intercontinental Singapore Robertson Quay. Went for a staycation to celebrate our anniversary and the service was absolutely impeccable.   A special shoutout to Thines, Shirley and Keyan; from the moment we stepped into the lounge, they were so attentive and friendly - my partner and I felt so much at home and our needs were exceedingly cared for. They also paid special attention to details; very genuine and personalized service.    We definitely look forward to coming back.,Reservation: Phenomenal. Email replies were speedy and helpful even before I booked the package on Klook. I requested for early check in and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call little past 12pm informing me that my room was ready. Really generous of them to do that. I ended up checking in only at 2.30pm. Included in my booking is an awesome late check out at 6pm.  Birthday amenities were also prepared (slice of cake and cookies) without having to prompt them on the day itself. Super impressed with how smooth the reservation process was (booked on Klook; emailed to follow up).  Room: Since the rooms here are smaller than other luxury hotels, I opted for a Quayside Suite (which had club lounge access). I had hesitatitated with the size as even the suite is only 38sqm, but I, love the natural light and modern touches. The bathroom was quite awkwardly designed since the room is open concept, with the bathtub tucked away in a corner, but I enjoyed the spacious-enough rain shower, which had romantic, filmic vibes (perfect for couples). Bath items smelled zesty and fresh. Housekeeping could be better though - one of the toothbrush packs were opened and without the toothpaste. First time that ever happened at a hotel stay.  Lounge: Intimate, classy, and spacious. Absolutely adore the lounge (in fact I prefer Robertson Quay's over Ritz Carlton's). If you want peace and quiet without kids running around or families talking over each other, look no further. There were a maximum of 4 people at the lounge whenever we visited. Sometimes it was just us two, so that upped the luxe and exclusive vibe.  -tea: Too many sweets, but well presented. No alcohol here but coffee was really good (had the latte and black). Savouries were by and large delicious. Best part was since we had late check out, we were graciously allowed to have afternoon tea again the next day, even though we only stayed overnight. There are very few clubs that are this generous.  -canapes: Wine and beer choices begin. No champagne, but I'm not a fan of that so prosecco sufficed. Keyan also introduced the sangria, which staff said is a one-off treat, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail and hope they introduce a menu. There were only four canapes but all were so tasty. Seriously - we asked for seconds. I love that the quality of the food is actually taken into consideration and free-flow. And oh, alfresco seating made the evening even lovelier.  -breakfast: Wow. Publico. Best breakfast I've had at a staycation. Coffee selection again looked bangin. The setting resembled a bougie cafe with impeccable, ultra attentive service. A lot of choices with the expansive menu, including a Singaporean selection and a continental one. Portions were also generous. I had the pancakes which were thankfully fluffy and not too sweet, followed by wanton noodles with a delicious savoury sauce. I wish the noodles itself was better, but generally the breakfast beats all the other hotels I've staycationed at in terms of vibe and taste.  Pool: While I liked how quiet the pool was (we were alone for 30 minutes), I think the experience could be better. Firstly, some of the daybeds were unusable because they were covered in bird sh it. Secondly, there were people cleaning (?) the building and were on ropes above the pool, which was awkward. The pool was unmanned which means tons of privacy (vibe again was right), but there is room for improvement.  Service: Attentive and friendly. I was passed a card to review on Tripadvisor but am happy to write this because the experience is one to remember. Thanks to Pauline, Stela, and Keyan for the lovely service at the lounge. The Publico breakfast staff as well for making us feel at home. Also to the staff at the express check out counter, who graciously helped my partner who misplaced his card. I love that the staff had initiative and seemed like they enjoyed working at the hotel. One of the best service at any staycation so far.  Overall ranking (since 2021): 1.

Mandarin Orchard / Deluxe King *day use, workation ~$180,…,Check In – I got to an empty lobby on level 4 at 1:30pm on a weekday and formalities was processed in 15mins; I was also granted a late checkout of 2pm upon asking. My room however was not ready and I was invited to the Club to enjoy afternoon tea.   Room – After 1.5 hour wait, I got my King Bed Classic Top Floor (28SqM), 904, at exactly 3pm. The room is laid out in pretty much an open-concept block which made the space feel much bigger than it is.Dressed in similar color tones as the public areas, the door opens up to a squarish layout of sorts, with the wardrobe (super nice bathrobes!) and enclosed toilet to your left (they share a sliding panel as their door but be warned that this door requires herculean strength so prep your biceps).  Club Intercontinental Lounge – Located, on level 4 of the property, this impressive space is (at least to me) the highlight of the property. The impressive entrance notwithstanding, the interior was super classy and reminiscent of an atas living room with cosy seating choices for 2-4pax. The abundance of natural lighting lights up the space in a nice way ie radiant but no direct sunrays.  All day (11:30am – 9:30pm) – light snacks and coffee / tea + other non alcoholic drinks are available for all day noshing in the pretty space. I saw nuts, chips, and dried fruits for options, alongside still / sparkling water amongst others.  Afternoon Tea (2-4pm): this was served in a 3-tier tray and the staff will explain the items as they serve it. I’m not a fan of carbs and too sweet stuff so this to me was just passable  Evening Cocktails (6-8pm): this was served in a set of 4 hot canapés, alongside choices of fruits, desserts, and salad cups. The selection and taste of the hot canepes were fantastic and I appreciated the thought behind curating a quality selection of bites versus other lounges who may be too enthusiastic about feeding you with senseless carbs and deep fried frozen something.  Service at the Club was excellent! Every staff I encountered was genuinely warm, super efficient, and would actively check in with you if you need anything else. I think being there on a weekday helped, but its been a while since I had great service from a Club Lounge. Thank you Pauline, Stela, and Keyan for enhancing my experience!

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,4.5,582 reviews,#64 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,,"Share, ,I have stayed for SHN in Singapore. First the room was very dark as adjacent to office buildings but great location for people working in finance. Light, outlet, bath, everything was broken or almost broken. Hot tub does not come out. TV is not clear. Flies everywhere.  The worst thing was service. I called the reception as I was not supposed to go out under quarantine. First, phone was half broken, second no one responded. Third, I asked for water and they didn't bring them and called them 3 times. And they don't. One time, a woman answered after so many calls and she complained that she is doing by herself and so busy....I don't know what is wrong with them.  I will never recommend to anyone and one of my worst experiences in my life. I have stayed many budget hotels and good, hotels, but none of them at this level. ,…,Just a few very minor things that marred my stay (but as you can see it did not stop me from giving the full rating): -There was a random fly - which I killed, and thereafter no more flies were found -On 1 occasion I had to call a few times to get housekeeping over, but I didn't mind, and in fact being able to observe how they did it was actually great. Housekeeping on some days could do with some improvement as I sometimes felt debris even right after housekeeping, but it was okay. -The taps were a bit loose and initially the shower/rain shower tap button thing wasn't working but the engineer came very promptly, and fixed it -TV was a bit blurry and the channels did not match the channel menu, but well I was there to work -The rubbish bin is a little too small (especially if, you order food deliveries) but I guess nothing can be done about that...a bigger rubbish bin would be pretty ugly.  What I loved: -Housekeeping seems exceptionally smart about what to clean and what to leave alone.  -Generous about replenishment, I was rationing out my laundry detergent but I need not have worried -Smooth experience all round from booking to checking out. Really loved the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, including housekeeping who asked me if I needed anything, and staff who welcomed me (didn't have to queue!) and helped with my luggage although it was just a single small bag on wheels -I absolutely love that housekeeping and maintenance removed their shoes before entering.  -THE WASHER DRYER. You can't see it in the pictures but it's there in one of the cupboards and I loved it. Not only that but they even have a laundry rack, dishwasher detergent, sponge, EVERYTHING you need to live in comfort.  Other neutral points to note were: -it was quiet until the weekend, where it got noticeably loud (both out on the streets and neighbours). Luckily, I was already checking out and had given up on working so it didn't matter. -The halal food options are not so great in Raffles Place, but it's fine if you're not picky and if you're willing to explore/travel a bit. Kind of had the overseas vibe too because I'm not familiar with RP and I was sometimes lost -My room had no natural light, but I was fine with it. Might want to take note though if you really want natural light, to check if there are rooms with some light. -Given there was no natural light, the lights had to stay on all the time - but it was also kind of dark with no desk light or reading light. Not disastrous as I can work in all conditions, but the atmosphere might be dull for some.   I gave full marks because I enjoyed my time so much that I wish I could have moved in permanently, and I did not expect to enjoy staying here so much given that RP is not really my cup of tea. Planning to make stays here a regular thing as I felt so much more motivated to work here, and this will definitely be my first choice if I need temporary accommodation. It's a little pricey but if I can get a good deal again I will definitely go for it.  Thank you to the team for delivering such great hospitality during my stay.,…,Pluses Great service and experience with the front desk staff. Spacious and well-maintained room.  Good location linking to Raffle place MRT Many restaurants are nearby.  The only minor negative for me is no room service on weekends.  ,Made a booking in May, however due to covid restrictions, had to reschedule till a later date. When I called back to confirm the date, they told me that it was too late and that they took it as a no-show. The manager, Irene Toh, was extremely sarcastic and was horrible in handling my case. I basically got robbed $290 from my booking which I did not stay in. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever come across, do not book this horrible place. Would rate it 0 stars if I could.,Stayed for 1 night here and my siblings love it! We were welcomed with open arms and immediately felt like home. Front desk Shaohan was extremely friendly. Gave me a late check out as well as he said I needed to rest after a nightshift. I am so thankful to be given such hospitality. Room was amazing and I regretted not upgrading my room. Will definitely come back for the higher room category! The best part was the toilet as it has a bidet and it is so spacious! I ordered food from outside and the front desk helped to inform me. Even asked my sister if she needed assistance to bring the food up.   The tv is small and old school but luckily we brought our laptop and HDMI cable to watch movies as the channels are very limited but it is not an issue for us as majority of the time we, played family games.   Overall, it was a pleasant stay! Will definitely come back again.,…","Centrally Located,Business",33854,Agoda.com,527,56,100

It's my 1st time utilising it and was having so much difficulties of the redemption.  I am amazed by your staffs Ms Mechelle & Mr Ramesh. They have so much patient in assisting me with the redemption despite their super busy shift. Their team work was splendid!  I was assisted until problem resolved! Wow..impressive.  Unfortunately on the same day, I accidebtly dropped my key pouch in the ladies toilet. Called the hotline and I was linked to Mr Rizal.  Key pouched was found as described by me. Mr Rizal have been so efficient with his actions and is superb, Great Extra Mile service. I was so delighted when my key pouch was found.  I believe all your staffs deserves a recognition as they are an asset to thw company. Precisely they deserves a pay raise too, especially to risk their life working during Covid-19.   Overall, all of you are awesome  it only i  food wise but service standard is TIP TOP. Super Swift ! Good job and keep it up!  Thank you.  Warmest regards,   Siti Aidah,…,Booked this hotel as a surprise staycay for my brother's birthday. Checking in was attended by Azleena and it was really smooth. She was friendly and helpful. She gave boxes of chocs to my brother for his birthday. Service and location was excellent. Thankful for the high floor facing the Sultan Mosque which gave amazing sunset views. ,My first time staying here and was greeted by their friendly customer service Azleena upon checking-in. The instruction and information was very clearly explain. We got the highest floor as requested and the view given was very spectacular. Really enjoy my staycay here.,Front desk staff members were friendly and approachable. Some of the staff looked a bit stoic probably because they were security officers.  Our hotel room was slightly dusty, the furniture were dated, but overall clean. We paid SGD$170++  The hotel is near to several yummy eateries and that is a plus point.   We shall be back again.,Check in and out was smooth. A housekeeper goes by the name of Faris, came early in the morning and asked whether our room can be clean up but told him there's no need to as we are still in the room. But, Faris gave the alternative timing to come instead. The room was superbly clean! Thank you so much Faris for the wonderful service!","Mid-range,City View",,,573,90,100
Citadines Balestier Singapore,4.5,30 reviews,#80 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Check in was quite fast. There were a number of forms need to complete prior to check in(no party policy, registration etc). Hanna at reception was courteous to explain regarding hotel. No hotel deposit required.  Room was good. Kitchenette available with microwave, sink and working desk. Toilet with a view. Love the ceiling to floor windows. Hotel is just 1 min away from bus stop and 2 mins to nearest convenience store.  Housekeeping is only 3 days per week. No on PH.   Check out was fast too, less than 5 mins.  Happy with the stay. Considering to book again the next time.,The second chapter of our reno-ventures – stay-out as we await our renovation to be complete. Noah asked for a complete tour of my childhood haunts, so we decided to stay in my childhood hood so we can do a proper comb-through of the nostalgia. Balestier has several heritage trail markers, truly making this an old-skool hotbed.  Citadines is the stand-out serviced apartment at the end of Balestier, a short cycle to Novena (yes, we brought our bikes). The newness excites – from the modern-art on display classy lobby (there’s an aromatic diffuser to seduce your stay) facing the come-dip-in-me-blue pool, to the tastefully done up modern units with sufficient kitchen amenities. We stayed at the studio apartment which has a kitchen with microwave, cutlery and service ware. It’s 2, sets of all so you have to put in extra requests for more but subject to approval. There isn’t a washing machine but they have machines at the reception area.  The bathroom is the most thrilling – rainforest shower to a HDB view of Balestier Road and beyond. Vitamin Spa toiletries smell heavenly and you get cleaning 3x weekly.  If you’re into nostalgia and heritage, Balestier throws up the old juxtaposed with the new. There’s a minimart downstairs or head to NTUC in the Whampoa market area. There is so much good food at the market or sink your teeth into the famous Eastern dumplings.  The only peeves are the constant trips to the reception asking for body lotion refills, requests for extra cutlery/service ware and pillows. All staff are warm and friendly making it a sweet stay. #eatstylishtravelstylish,…,Wonderful place for Staycation! I love the room . Utensils al included . High floor and can’t complain . The cafe below serves nice foods . There is minimarts close at 12am . They got everything, worth paying for the room . I will go back again . Clean and Super nice . ,One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. I’ve stayed here for 7.5 months due to being stuck in Singapore because of Covid. The staff, specifically Mary Ann, has been extremely rude and inhospitable. When requesting extra sugar packets or coffee sachets, as per their regulation they only replenish it ONCE during your stay which means ONCE during the 7.5 months I’ve been here.   It’s meant to be a “apart-hotel” as advertised but there is ZERO “hotel” amenities. No room service. No proper cleaning. Their housekeeping is outsourced by the way so Citadines has NO responsibility over housekeeping. Which means that when the apartment is full of dust (which it always is), unclean silverware (many times) and non-English speaking cleaners, the apartment took NO responsibility and would, just blame housekeeping.   Apparently I just found out that for long term guests they do thorough in-depth cleaning once a month. They NEVER did it until month 5-6 after I forced them to do it.   They have a policy of wearing masks in public areas except the swimming pool however there is CCTV footage of a guest NOT wearing a mark between the 20-22nd of October right in the lobby, IN FRONTAL VIEW of the reception. However they have tried to reprimand me of not wearing a mask post-swimming in the outdoors area when there was NOT ONE PERSON there besides me.   I have many many other grievances from the hospitality of their security, 3 hours to get fresh towels, etc which should be basic expectations for someone who’s stayed for over 7 months and paid over S$25,000 during my stay.   I’m only writing this review because they have done NOTHING to change their ways and it has been quite disappointing. ,…,Citadines -  Your customer service has been amazing. Our trip to Singapore was cancelled due to Covid19 in October 2020, booked a non refundable room and your team went out of their way to allow us a refund. We received it very quickly indeed. Although we never stayed, you have the gone extra mile for us - THANKYOU",,,,268,26,78
Hotel 81 Geylang,3.0,330 reviews,#241 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Secured parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Singapore. We had a very great time in Hotel 81 Geylang.  Jimmy ( hotel manager) is above and beyond, always making sure us feeling welcomed during our stay. He provided us a 5-star customer service, didn’t hesitate to offer his muscle to load our heavy luggages into taxi. We will definitely come back to hotel 81 Geylang again, and highly recommend it to others visiting Singapore. ,Property is very clean with reasonable amout. If you get use to toilet washer (the host) you can't find it here in this hotel. Air conditioning is very cold, it seems can't be adjusted, not sure if it's broken or not. TV channel option is quite good with you tube access provided. But if you traveling with kids be prepared with surrounding area, as this area is in the red light district of Singapore 😅. By the way you can find food (halal mamak) easy, walking distance only,The price was good, and the staff were super friendly and helpful.  But the room was small, noisy, not very clean, with no storage space and an uncomfortable bed.  Tolerable but not enjoyable.  The neighborhood didn't feel unsafe, but it was clearly a working class neighborhood.  The neighborhood restaurants seemed unsanitary, which meant a subway ride for all meals.  I wouldn't stay here again.,I dont know, what is everything in Singapore so expensive or not? I think I pay this hotel not cheap, after I see my room, you know my room so small and looks so old, and you know location this hotel I think in red distric, but if you Muslim many halal shop in here ,,Worst place ever been and worst experience in a hotel room don't even think about to make reservations there is also a lot of prostitutions in the area...I got sick on the first day we arrive there and my husband cannot even sit on the bed because of the bad smell inside the room",Budget,,,71,8,78

Stayed for 2 weeks in family room for 4. Personnel very helpful and accommodated all our needs. Lot of restaurants around and close to MRT. Complementary parking. If you have to work while staying here, make sure you take advantage of the meeting room they have available.  Due to COVID-19 restrictions light breakfast only for pick-up but arranged well and lady in breakfast room very helpful.,We stayed in 2 bed apartment for just over 4 months throughout Singapore's Covid-19 ""circuit breaker"" period. We were delighted that we chose this venue for our stay. The property was so centrally located that we were able to get all our food, supplies and necessities from shops and supermarkets within easy walking distance. Our apartment was well-equipped with cooking and laundry facilities and served us well as a home away from home. The reception and housekeeping team worked extremely hard to attend to our every needs and kept our room very clean and fresh.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to a) Reception team - Suzana, Keith, Ricole, Chan (Security) and Shoufi b), House keeping team - Mohd Sani, Suk Ing, Noorsia, Han, Chen and c) Breakfast team. We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay and have booked to come back in October.,…,Great hospitality, friendly, efficient and clean.   Great location, with so many restaurant and cafe options along the riverside and nearby.  Perfect as a pet friendly accommodation option , with our Dogs being able to enjoy the nice walks along the riverside.,I had a great stay at VRRQ. Cleanliness, friendliness of staff and location are top-notch.   One person in particular I’d like to call out is Parthi, one of the cleaning team staff. He is superb - thorough, meticulous and thoughtful (he brought me a extension cord when he saw me struggling with all my wires) and clean. Great attitude.  Only downside is that the building is old - so do not expect a modern looking building. It also required a climb of some stairs to my room (not all rooms require a climb though). But this was compensated for in views, as these rooms have views that look over Clarke Quay and the river.   Would recommend 10/10!  Thanks to the team - keep it up!,Thank you so much to the staff at Village Residence Robertson Quay. Comfortable beds, hot showers, and excellent facilities. Everyone was so friendly, especially Parthi. The birthday cake was a lovely surprise too! We would definitely come back.","Green,Great View",,,275,45,100

Housekeeping staff comes about 2-3 times a week, Parthipan in particular did the cleaning the room, the kitchen and bathroom thoroughly and quickly.    The location is nice, you can stroll along riverside days and nights.  Many restaurants around, various choices of cuisines around the area.,We were leaving Singapore and were looking at many options to fullfil our family needs for the last week before our departure. Village Residence ticked all our boxes - Good size apartment with own room for the children, allowing our pet cat to stay with us, very nice pool area, laundry tokens included in room price, and good media content on the TV, and very important for us was a very well equipped kitchen to cook our own food. We also liked the central location with buses going to all our relevant locations (Orchard, East Coast) just around the corner and MRT a short walk away. Thank you to Jonathan, Anne and the other staff for being so service-minded and considerate of our last week of stay in Singapore!!!,It is my first time here in Singapore and I felt so warmed welcome here in this village residence. This place location is very accessible and convinient to us, staff are very cooperative, rooms and recreational facilities are always tidy.

Regency House by Far East Hospitality,4.5,451 reviews,#5 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,We stayed at the Regency House during the last week of April 2009. The booking was made through Agoda at a rate of $130 per night. Remember this is not a hotel. It is a serviced apartment. We booked a studio room, but upgraded to 2 bedroom apartment free of charge. The apartment is spacious, the furniture is modern and posh. The kitchen has all what you need to cook a meal, has a washer/dryer, microwave and all utensils for 4 people. There were 3 separate controls for AC. You can buy grocery from basement supermarket at Plaza Singapura or Centerpoint, both are a short walk.  The pool is very nice for an evening soak. Pool wasn’t crowded while we were there.  A maid came on all weekdays and on Saturday to clean the apartment and change towels.etc except May 01, which is a public, holiday in Singapore.  We didn’t go for the weekday free breakfast, so cannot comment on it. We had free high speed internet in room with our own router. Also 2 TVs with lot of cable channles, and nice little audio/DVD player.  My only complaint was the bathroom is unusually small, and has a shower only. This is very unusual compared to other facilities provided. Also for 2 consecutive days, there were some construction noise during the day time from a adjoining room. Also the Airport shared shuttle services are not provided to this location since it is not a hotel, so you needed to take a cab.  Location is very good, just a step away from Orchard Road busy shopping, MRT station, Fort Canning park etc. Also there is a free shuttle bus from MRT station to 3 nearby locations.  Overall, we are happy with our decision to go for a Regency House instead of a hotel.  If you get a deal like ours, please go for it.,…,We usually stay at the Forest by Wangz, but since it was booked solid we chose Regency House, and we were very happy with our selection. We have no criticisms. The building is centrally located and 5 minutes away from Orchard Road; 10 minutes from 2 MRT stations and 2 Cold Storage supermarkets; and plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The staff were warm and hospitable and housekeeping kept our apartment spotless. Breakfast was a good, eclectic selection. Our two bed-roomed apartment was approx. 800 sq ft, so plenty of space for our energetic toddler. All told it was a relaxing, stress-free stay and we look forward to returning.,I am writing this whilst still here.   The Pros-good location as its close to the shops and restaurants; staff are very warm and friendly; internet service was very fast and easy to connect to. I have often found this a clhallenge in some other hotels I have been to.  The cons - i think breakfast tine should be extended because of travellers who come from different time zones.  We travelled all the way from Nigeria, and couldn't get to bed before 3am, and obviously, we got up way after breakfast. I also think the choices should be expanded . The one time we made it for breakfast, the scrambled egg looked most uninviting.  The cleaners came in/come in daily, but do very little - they change the sheets and towels without prompting, but  other than that, little else was done. After, ""cleaning"" the bathrooms, there were still signs of toothpaste marks, dried water marks on the shower door, i had to prompt the cleaners to empty the bins in the rooms more than twice. In addition, we found tubes under the bed that belonged to obviously some other occupant. Now i wonder how long that had been there; it shows the lack of thoroughness in the cleaning exercise.,…,Located right accross sultana park and orchard road, 10 min. walk from Plaza singapura and the train station. Very nice suite rooms, up to standards of singapore hotels which always feels new and nice. The breakfast though is very limited to a light one. Pool at the top level is inviting.,Reception: The check in was smooth and pleasant.  The reception team was very attentive and ready to help.  The lobby size is sufficiently for transit and has coffee to go.   Room: The corridor to apartment unit is rather narrow, but bright and open air though.  Our unit on 10th floor was conveniently located opposite breakfast lounge and swimming pool and small gym.  The room size is large and fully equipped with kitchen appliances and utensils. My kids love to have meals at the breakfast area .. feeling like home ..  TV channels are plenty to choose .. It has sofa and can fit an extra bed easily.   Breakfast: Continental breakfast with daily 2 hot meals is more than enough for simple easy breakfast .. If miss your usual home cooking, can always buy from nearest supermarkets, and cook your own in your own kitchen .. Or heat up takeaways .. haha FYI the breakfast lounge is unfortunately closed during holidays and weekends.. so the kitchen comes handy .. or go to nearby restaurants   Location: Strategically located in between 2 MRT stations : Dhoby Gaut and Somerset  Walking distance to Orchard Road, Orchardgateway mall, 313 mall, 111, Plaza Singapura, etc ..  Nearby supermarkets : Japanese Donki Donki @Orchard Central, Fairprice Finest @111  Just opposite the Istana Park and a walking distance to beautiful historical Fort Canning Park (photos attached).   This apartment was available only for minimum 6 days stay during our year end holidays ..

A nice boutique hotel to stay with your loved one. Quiet and convenient. Room ambience is good but personally dun like bathroom and toilet separated  ,The hotel is situated within the renovated shophouses of Singapore early days that's been preserved as part of the heritage and well integrated into the current Far East Square as it is known today.  Located a few minutes walk away from Telok Ayer MRT and nearby Amoy St as well as Chinatown where many great F&B outlets resides, it isn't much of an issue travelling around or finding the venue for your next meal. The oriental decors within is stands out pleasantly from the moment you arrive at the lobby, and we were pleasantly surprised by the welcome drink that was served to us in what resembled to those wine bottles and bowls used in ancient China.   Rooms were very spacious and had the same oriental feel as well as elements of nolstalgia, ranging from the old school telephone, to tingkats used to contain some snacks. Due to the way the hotel was built, we were informed that no rooms are identical in terms of layout. Since this staycation was for my significant other's birthday, there was this handmade souvenir they've prepared for her. with some personalised touch and a handwritten note.   The hospitality and service shown by the staff throughout our 2 nights there were excellent, acceding to our requests and helping me out with some of these requests prior to our stay. Special mention to Bryan for the service before and during our stay too. The recently added heritage tour in the vicinity was a great eyeopener led by the manager Alvin, which we learnt a lot about the stories that came with the history of Singapore and hidden corners with paintings and murals. It definitely made it to the highlight of the stay.  Will we come back for a stay? Definitely. With the great location, comfortable room and the superbly high standards of service that left us with such great memories, it's hard not to consider coming back for another staycation.

"Oasia Hotel Downtown, Singapore by Far East Hospitality",4.5,"3,053 reviews",#39 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,My husband and I visited Oasia over the weekend (26 to 27 Oct) to celebrate his birthday. This was the very first visit we had at Oasia club room and we were impressed by how Oasia serves the customer even during this season of pandemic. The staffs were frequently seen disinfecting the seats around the poolside and club room. Even though there were not much snacks at the club room, probably to abide by the safety measures, the staff were always very friendly and approachable. I can sense that they were probably understaffed, but the two male executives (one was Xavier, the other one I could not catch his name, but a tall bespectacled man) were still attentive to our needs. For instance, we were having breakfast and Xavier was very attentive to wind down the curtains as the, sunlight was shining into the windows where we were seated at. I hope this will encourage the staff working at the frontline during this pandemic as it is definitely not easy to be at the frontline during COVID-19. Thanks for the memorable visit and we will return for a staycation again soon! :),…,I decided to stay here for staycation as it's situated in the center of Singapore and they offer a package that includes breakfast, afternoon tea and late check-out until 3pm! The check in staff was very polite and professional. He explained about the package and also asked if I want to book a gym or a pool as they make sure that they limit the number of people who use the facilities. High tea was at the restaurant located on the first floor, and they'll give you a pot of tea and a traditional 3 tier afternoon tea set. Breakfast was also at the same restaurant, and you'll have a few options to choose from. Highly recommend this hotel!,I stayed at the Oasia downtown for one night in May 2021 using one of my Amex vouchers. The staff were friendly and helpful, and I'd like to give a shoutout to Alvies for the friendly bar cart service.   The rooms were well kept and well decorated, and the swimming pools were good as well.   Due to the covid measures at the time of my stay, I was not able to make use of the club lounge or gym, though the hotel did provide a yoga mat in room, and provided the club lounge benefits in room as well.   There are two areas for improvement: 1. The Wifi is very troublesome to connect to, and was incredibly slow, making any work difficult 2. The in-room breakfast service could have benefitted from more variety, my breakfast was also a little cold when it arrived so perhaps a heated, trolley could have helped as well. ,…,Pros: The interior is fantastic with the modern urban feel with delicates vibrancy  Roof top pool are quiet  (maybe that Is Low seasons during our stay) . Screenings surrounded and open to sky give an open yet private feel.  The intermediate sky deck where another pool, private lounge and hotel lobby is is quite amazing  Room is modern and trendy . Well functional and room size just nice.  Come with package of complimentary hi-tea and my kids enjoy it Central locations with lots of eateries around   Cons: The nice pool at the intermediate level only for adults and kids not allowed . Kids can only go to roof top pool. Is a pity but family travellers but for business travellers it would be quiet and exclusive   Conclusion: For business travellers, I think is worth it and you can, have a nice, quiet yet trendy and exclusive space for the stay and amidst central location. ,…,The stay was pleasant and the location of the hotel is superb, Since dine-in i s not allowed nowadays, the eatery and restaurant around the hotel become so important! And there are so many things to eat around the hotel especially japanese food and korean food.  the hotel was chic and clean and the staffs were all friendly throughout my stay. However the cleanliness of the room can be improve as when i was picking up something from the floor i saw there was a lot of dust under the small cabinet beside the bed, and it seemed like no one has been cleaning the area for a very long time.

Staff very helpful and courteous with an eye and era to please you. I recommend its location close to Orchard Road and Paragon Shopping centre,We had a splendid time at Oakwood Studio and the bonus is a rooftop BBQ pit by the pool. The service was awesome even before our arrival, we were very well taken care of by Olesia and her team. Christine gave us a tour of the apartment and show us all the technology in the room, it was very helpful unlike other places that would leave you alone to figure it all out. They do a special cocktail and canapes hours on Wednesday which is a nice touch to the establishment. Lobby is great for relaxation with the different sitting areas and all day beverages available for the guests. The interior decor is fresh and funky, staff are helpful and upbeat, and it was a great experience overall! Would definitely like to spend more time again,Oakwood Studios are located in one of the most commercially and culturally important areas of Singapore.   Enough said about the location  Staff and the service are amongst the best we have seen amongst any of our stays in Singapore.  ","Modern,Mid-range",,,275,47,100

MRT Stations are within walking distance. Food and drink shops everywhere around the hostel. Staff are friendly and probably one of few hostels that are family friendly,Seriously everything is perfect - the home comfort feel, decorations, breakfast and local coffee, Boat Quay location, room cleanliness and privacy, etc. Thank you SO much Chucky, Risa, and Aisha for the wonderful stay!!,Everything was amazing, the decorations and home comfort feel, friendly staff, great location, breakfast and local coffee, clean everywhere. Can't praise it enough! Thank you Chucky and Risa and Aisha :)),Definitely one of the best hostels i stayed in my life. It exceeded my expectations at all. The staff, the room, the premisses and it uniques details, the venue closed to the bars and restaurants, easiness of transport.  I recpmmend to all people that intends to visit Singapore!,Hostel is walking distance to Clarke Quay, Downtown, Esplanade, and all the major tourist attractions. A handful of affordable restaurants are right outside your door. The Double Loft Bed is perfect for couples who want privacy and more space. The hostel looks and feels cozy, warm, and clean.

Copthorne King's Hotel Singapore on Havelock Road,3.5,"1,762 reviews",#137 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,You get a good vibe from this hotel, as soon as you arrive the staff are helpful and friendly. We arrived early and were prepared to leave our bags and have to return to check in later, however, we were thrilled to find out the room was ready and we could go straight up. After two flights from England we were over the moon to hear this. We’d paid for an upgrade to a balcony room, which was great, only the balconies are very small meaning you are unable to sit out on them. If the doors opened inward it would leave a lot more room to be able to access the balcony.  The room was clean and comfortable, it had plenty of light and felt open and airy. We immediately put the kettle on and had a tea (all provided by the hotel) and got to grips with the room, discovering all it had to, offer.  We had breakfast included in our stay which was delightful. There was a great choice of all breakfast items, Eastern and Western, making the morning meal a process of great discovery. The pancake machine was delicious and I had the chocolate cereal each day (still miss that cereal!), it really had everything you could want.  We found the staff amiable and only had one issue (we paid for late check out which was advertised in the room literature as 6pm but on the reception desk it was 5pm. The stated time of 6pm was given to us though after some quibble), the issue was rectified quickly though. The pool facilities were great for a night time dip and the laundry facilities were a life saver. It’s great to have the option of the hotel cleaning your clothes for you or the access to do it yourselves.  There is a petrol station located a few doors down from the hotel, which is a really handy place to pick up milk and snacks. There is a fridge in the room to store milk should you need to.  All in all a very decent hotel, great location and easy to get to. It was lovely and quiet too! We would certainly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay their again. We stayed for 4 nights in total which was great.,…,I stayed here with my husband and six year old child just after the SARS epidemic, enroute to New Zealand.  The staff were friendly, helpful and full of smiles.  The room, a triple, had a balcony and a view over the city skyline.  It was clean and spacious with air-con.  Beware of the mini-bars and the 'snacks' in the room, they are expensive, particularly the bottled water; this trick is employed everywhere and not exclusive to this hotel.    The Breakfast was buffet style and delicious.  Lunch and dinner are served the same way.  We had dinner at the hotel and have to say that for a buffet, it was excellent and tremendous value when combined with the Singapore Stopover vouchers (available at the airport).  Would stay again for sure. ,First of all I came to this hotel as a last minute choice. I was planning on staying in Kuala Lumpur and traveling to Singapore the next day to get a flight but felt better about spending the night in Singapore to avoid traffic the next day.   I had been in S.E. Asia for about a month and spent several days at the Meritus Mandarin in Singapore upon my arrival and was a bit let down. I must say I was more impressed with the Copthorne King than I was with the Meritus Mandarin. First of all the price was excellent, considering we booked 1 day in advance, about Singaporean $90 (around $55 U.S.).   We arrived rather late and they were quite accommodating. They said they could hold their famous Penang buffet if we wanted but we told them not to as it was already time for it to be, closed and we didn���������t want to hold anyone over. We did decide to order ala��������� carte though and I had a wonderful bit of Salmon. The prices were also fairly good and the food was excellent. The Penang buffet looked fantastic and I am sorry we missed it.   They have a nice little bar in the lobby and had a fairly good band from the Philippines playing live. I love live music and it was a nice option to have for me. He bar was very clean and packed with interesting people.  The bell captain was very attentive, asking us if we needed advice on where to go and how to get there. He took us up to our room and showed us all the light switches, told us about the different T.V. channels, and informed us about the entertainment and food specials at the hotel. He didn���������t seem to be begging for a tip but genuinely interested in talking to us.  The room itself was a bit small but VERY VERY clean and decorated in a very nice way. Even though it was small and well priced the room felt more expensive than it was due to the decorations and the overall well maintained feel. The view was excellent as one whole wall of the room was part of the curved fa������ade of the hotel. It offered a semi-panoramic view of the city.   Overall it felt much more like a 4 star hotel than a 3 star. I would say its head and shoulders above the 4 star rated Meritus Mandarin in cleanliness and service. ,…,THIS HOTEL IS BRILLIANT!!!  I and my partner stayed here for a 2 night stop over and all I can say is that I wish we had longer here cos this place is brilliant.  This was our first trip to Singapore and I wasn’t really sure what we were going to find. We arrived at ‘THE COPTHORNE KINGS’ at approximately 7.30am after a long flight from the UK. Check in time was not until 2pm but the staff saw to it that we could get changed and freshen up and then left our bags with the porter who was extremely helpful.  The reception staff were really friendly and super helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. I wish every hotel was like this…  When we eventually got back and were shown to our room, they had upgraded us to a superior room at no extra cost as they were suffering a busy, period. The room that we were given was beautiful and gave us panoramic views of Singapore which has to be seen at night to fully appreciate its glory…  The room came complete with a T.V and refrigerator/mini bar, along with the nicest bed and softest linen/pillows…  The bathroom was to die for with large sink/basin and a wonderful power shower. The room cam equipped with air con that was an absolute god send when you have tramped the streets and shops all day in the humid heat.  The hotel boasts award winning cuisine, however, I have to confess that we didn’t eat there as there were far too many nice restaurants in various parts of the city that we were so desperate to try out. I can concur with other tripadvisor reports that the restaurant was always packed full, morning and night.  For breakfast we went across the footbridge directly outside the hotel and went and sat by the river every morning at a quaint little place called ‘SIMPLY BREAD’ it is exactly what is says on the tin… but the bread is baked there fresh daily and is to die for.. Mmmmm there coffee is also out of this world…  At night we chose to walk it to the lively parts including boat quay and Clarke quay which are only a stone throw from the hotel. ‘THE COPTHORNE KINGS’ is not situated directly in the heart of it all, but to be honest I liked that and thought that its location was perfect. We walked it to town each morning and got a taxi back, make sure you get a proper marked taxi and it will only cost you roughly £2 English pounds…  The pool, steam room and sauna proved invaluable to me to have a cool off in an afternoon before hitting the streets again for the night session. There was never anyone in the pool or using any of the other facilities which was kind of nice as I had it all to myself.  If there is anything else you want to know about ‘THE COPTHORNE KINGS’ then please ask and I will try my utmost to assist..  If you are planning a trip to Singapore I highly recommend staying at ‘THE COPTHORNE KINGS’ Singapore is one of the best cities that I have ever visited and I will return sometime soon cos there is so much to see and do. When we return we will without a shadow of a doubt be staying at ‘THE COPTHORNE KINGS’ it only cost us £40 per night for the both of us… now that’s a bargain… :-)   Paddy :-)  ,…,The hotel is very good. Rooms are confortable and clean; everything's new and well equipped. Breakfast is magnificient. However, some minors details could be improved: the A/C is terribly cold; the cleaning staff often leaves glasses and cups without being washed, as well as trash in the bins; and the front desk employees could work a tad in their hospitality. Location is OK (really lovely neighbourhood), but the metro is nowhere near.","Mid-range,City View",,,105,16,99
"Villa Samadhi, Singapore",4.5,323 reviews,#44 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,We were blown away by our stay at the Crib room in Villa Samadhi. We stayed from 30th Dec to 1st January. The service was impeccable and the best I have experienced so far. Having travelled to many countries and experienced staying in many different accommodation, the service in Villa Samadhi is unrivalled. We were spoiled from the time we arrived and checked in. One of the lady staff (apologies missed her name) checked us in and the process is so simple and personalised. We were then greeted by Jaya who took us to our room and shown us the rooms and facilities. The room is rustic and has that certain old charm. There are a couple of issues with the room but very minor, as it is not a new property. I was from a hospitality industry many years ago so understood the maintenance, that comes with this type of property. All the amenities are very well thought and considered.  We had our welcome drink and the breakfast on both days were amazing - pastries, fruits and a hot cooked meal. Nothing to complain about. We were greeted by all the staff in a very welcoming and friendly way.   We requested for a late checkout and was granted easily with no questions asked. If you are looking for a staycation or to celebrate any events, this is the place to be. It is away from the hustle and bustle of city life but close enough to drive to town. We love waking up to birds chirping and the smell of soil, plants, flowers and greenery after the rain is a nice change from the city pollutants.   Highly recommended this property. Will definitely be recommending this property to my friends and will return next time. Thank you to all the wonderful staff that made our stay a memorable one.  The property is set in a very beautiful nature reserve, where walks through the Labrador Park is easy and scenic. Lots of beautiful nature and historical lessons to be learned.,…,The hotel rates are pricey and the rooms aren’t that big. Though the settings are rustic, set in a nature reserve, I’m not sure if that commands a premium.   If you booked through third party website, you don’t get welcome drinks, dining discount at Tamarind Hill. Better to book direct. May even get cheaper rates.,It was my wife's birthday so I booked Sarang Room for a night's stay through Agoda.   When we arrived at the hotel, we were shown to another cheaper room. We were told that Sarang room was not available and were asked to contact Agoda with regards to the matter.   We did not accept the cheaper room and left the property.   I am not sure if its a system error or a coordination problem as Agoda mentioned that there was a middle man liaising with Villa Samadhi. Anyways, did not expect such a mistake.   A very bad experience for us. We are still waiting for the refund.,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent two night staycation at Villa Samadhi in Labrador Park, Singapore.  The attention to detail by the top-notch and friendly Villa staff only enhanced the get-a-way from it all tranquility of the property.  In addition, a short stroll to their restaurant, Tamarind Hill, for breakfast and dinner allowed us to enjoy food and drinks prepared and served by Ros and her professional team. The turn-down service with port capped-off our days. Already looking forward to a return visit.,I had a return stay to Villa Samadhi for a staycation and absolutely loved it. Nestled in a jungle in Labrador Park, this location is about as remote as you can find in Singapore. The large rooms are well-appointed, with amazing plunge pools and colonial charm.   The Tamarind Restaurant (part of the hotel) is a short walk through the jungle and the food is devine.","Romantic,Boutique",19138,Agoda.com,74,11,65
M Hotel Singapore City Centre,4.0,"2,262 reviews",#69 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Visited cafe2000 on 13Nov 21  for buffet dinner with my family to celebrate my son's Birthday . He enjoyed the selections of the grills while me and my hubby were delighted with the range of seafood that was served. It's was  full house but the staff were seen doing their  best to serve . I would like to take this opportunity to compliment one staff by the name of Anna . She provided an excellent service to us . Helping us to check on our orders several times when she noticed that our food was not served yet.  Her friendly disposition also make us feel welcome we will definitely recommend this place for buffet.,Before COVID, I used to come with my family. It's a pity after 1 month of re-opening, we are hit with Phase 2 (Phase 1.5 actually). The meat dishes are better than before, however for non-beef eaters, you are left with Chicken & Lamb dishes as this restaurant is now hall certified. But on another note, this restaurant moves 1 step further into being more inclusive to our muslim friends.  The service is good. I liked the new format of ordering through the servers compared to the old normal where the food usually becomes a scary sight after the other customers had worked on them. The presentation of the platters are appetising.  The servers are friendly as well. Do not hesitate to request for a pair of gloves to peel your prawns and raw food before going into the pot. It protects, your hands from the fishy smell after you get home.  Overall, I like the new format and the service as usual. If not for the new heightened measures, I will be back with my family and friends.,…,Went for dinner the Buffer of M Hotel,It was lovely dinner on nice weather. We were enjoying the foods as well as the staffs well been served to us.👍🏽 We felt warm and feel home the way they treated us feel comfortable.  Staffs: Amelyn,Princess,Julie,Alan,Robert,Chef Boz and more that we can’t recalled their names.  And also,we both had something nice hot beverages in Cafe2000. They provide very good service too.Staffs: Firuz,Sara,Shawn,Suresh & many more. We both felt most welcome. We will coming back again,FOR SURE! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽,One of the worst buffet ever been. Selection limited, first time I never order second round for my buffet food as non are worth reordered.   Impressed with the first ""complimentary seafood platter"". However Seafood not fresh, only prawn is ok. Pepper crab are soggy,  meat platter, some overcook, some undercooked. Cooked vegetables are yellow and soggy, cooked for hours ?   Never ever order the meatball spaghette, I can even cook better than this. Beef stew are horrible, the meat like been cooked for many times, very dry, definitely not freshly cook.   Dessert are decent,  nothing interesting.   Overall all service is ok , sometimes have to call multiple times for service but I guess they are short of staffs.   For the price I can go for other 5 stars hotel with better fresher, food.,…,The food was really nice. All the food in list that given when u arrived is very tempting and mouth watering especially to me who always hungry type. Hahaha. Staff are well trained and all of them give the best service ever.

Amara Singapore,4.0,"3,446 reviews",#36 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean","Share, ,Check in was smooth and staff were very experienced in handling it. Special thanks to Ms Siti and Mr Raymond from front office as they make the whole process easy and fast. Breakfast is good and quality is excellent. Swimming pool is very well maintained and clean. Will definitely come back again,Took a recent staycation at Amara Hotel due to a wonderful online promo. Located at Tanjong Pagar, this 4-star hotel has a very spacious and inviting lobby in arrival.  Check-In Process Due to the earlier issues they had with check-in at the start of the promo, they had moved check-in to the 3rd floor. This allowed a bigger space for check-in registration. Check-In Time officially begins at 3pm but one can try their luck and arrive around 11:30am and may get a room if any is ready but should not get upset if no rooms become available till 3pm. Check-out Time for those on the promo is 3pm but for others it is 11am. After registration, there was a wait of about 20 mins to 30 mins for the room key to be ready for collection. During the wait, a ballroom was open with simple coffee, and tea, and projection of local TV on the screen to help past time. Once the room key is ready for collection, a phone call will be made and then one proceeds to the first floor check-in counter to collect the room key.  Room Impressions The rooms, though dated, were spacious and had a separate shower and bathtub. This is especially important as it allowed for a safer shower or bath time. The bathrooms uses a double leaf door so there will always be a slight gap and it cannot be locked but should be fine unless your roommate is a problem. The shower area only has a rainfall shower fixture so for those used to being able to direct the water flow with a handheld showerhead, there is one over at the bathtub. Each room comes with free WiFi connectivity during the duration of the stay. The rooms typically only have 2 views, either of the condominium behind or Tanjong Pagar Plaza and Pinnacle@Duxton on the front. The beds were firm but the pillows were really a little too soft. This can be rectified by giving a call to Housekeeping to request for a firm pillow, subject to availability. The only issue with the room is that the air con can get a little too cold and even switching it off is not really switching it off as the air con still flows when turned off. This could likely be a problem seen with older hotels where the air con control in the room is limited in functions even when it shows more or only a placebo with no real control at all with the air con being centrally controlled.  Hotel Amenities The hotel has a lovely 30m pool on site, allowing maybe 3 persons swimming in a straight line sufficient space to swim comfortably, but it requires prior booking for a 1 hour time slot. Due to COVID-19 Safe Management Measures, only 8 persons are allowed in the pool area at any one time. Access to the pool is controlled by the hotel concierge so one needs to head to the concierge to first collect the pool towels before being escorted up to Level 6 where the pool is, and the hotel staff will then open the access door to the Swimming Pool with an access card that only they carry. Should it be drizzling or raining, the pool will be closed and affected guests will have to book another time slot on their own. The hotel has a gym too but it is currently closed due to COVID-19 Safe Management Measures.   Club Room Privileges  For those who have booked the club rooms, there are additional perks. With the club lounge being closed, club lounge benefits are now provided at the ground floor dining restaurant.  - All-Day Drinks: there are only 4 types of tea to choose from with no soft drinks, alcohol or even plain coffee being served and no finger snacks too.  - Afternoon Tea: there are some finger snacks and again the same 4 types of tea.  - Evening Cocktails: there are some light bites and more options in terms of drinks this time with coffee and alcohol but some options are usually not available such as the Asahi Super Dry beer.  - Breakfast: there are 4 different types of mains, of which only one can be chosen, plus some fruits and sandwiches, and tea or coffee will be served along with fruit drinks made from cordial or concentrate. For those with a non-dairy diet or any types of special diet, breakfast provided is only cut fruits, which is a shame with such poor options.  - In-Room Service: Club Room guests get to send 2 pieces of laundry per room each day for free standard washing and they will be returned the next evening. Club Room guests also get a set of free welcome drinks of 2 cans of Coca Cola and 2 small bottles of Fruit Juice in the fridge (minibar) which will not be replenished during the stay.  - All the above are not available to guests who had booked Normal/Deluxe Rooms but then got a free upgrade to the Club Rooms due to whatever reasons.  Differences Between Normal/Deluxe Rooms and the Club Rooms - Size: the Normal/Deluxe Rooms and the Club Rooms are of the same size, just that the Club Rooms are on the upper 2 floors.  - Room Amenities: it is the same except that the Club Rooms have a dedicated desk and slightly newer TV but the cable box signal to the TV is just as bad in either rooms, with either room types' TV suffering the same washed out (overbright) issue.  - TV Connectivity: do bring your own HDMI cable if you wish to plug in your own mobile/electronic devices as the TVs are not up to date to support direct from Mobile Device to TV wireless connectivity. The TV image does improve slightly when connected via HDMI.  - Bathroom:  it is the same except that the toilet seat in the Normal/Deluxe Rooms do not come with a damper, so be prepared for a lot of slamming of the toilet seats when lifting or putting them down if one is in a Normal/Deluxe Room. - Arm Chair: Both room types have an arm chair but of different designs, with the Normal/Deluxe Rooms having a cozier armchair with an additional foot stool while the Club Rooms have a wider arm chair but no foot stool.  Choosing between a Normal/Deluxe Room and a Club Room On a personal note, the money saved by booking a Normal/Deluxe Room can give one much better food and drinks at the Hawker Centre across the road or at the neighbouring 100AM Mall, while one does not lose much in terms of amenities or floor space between a Normal/Deluxe Room and a Club Room.  Power Points in the Room With the hotel's rooms being older, power points are limited, so bring a multi-plug or a power points extension to provide more charging points for your devices. Do note that some of the wall sockets can only support a single device plugged in and are not able to support a multi-plug or a power points extension. Do remember to take your power plug home with you when you check-out for if you should leave it behind, it is likely to be lost to you forever.  Hotel Restaurants and Nearby Eateries The hotel does not have any tie in with their onsite restaurants so hotel guests do not get any discount when visiting any of them. The hotel does have its own access way into 100AM mall by the side of the ground floor restaurant and coffeehouse, so there is no need to head on out and in again. There are plenty of eateries, Hawker Stalls, and even Michelin Starred (overseas) and Michelin Bibbed (Both local and overseas) eateries within a stone's throw from the hotel, so one would never be afraid of going hungry. With a 24 hour supermarket, NTUC Fairprice, and a 7-ELEVEn just across the road from the hotel, one does not need to worry about midnight hunger pangs too.  Guests on SHN or 1 Day Quarantine pending PCR results arriving on VTL Like any other hotel in Singapore, Amara Singapore is also accepting guests for SHN or 1 Day Quarantine pending PCR results for new arrivals to Singapore via the VTL. If this is an issue for you, perhaps this hotel is not for you and you should be looking for hotels in the SG$800++ per night range as it is unlikely those on SHN or 1 Day Quarantine will be staying at hotels with such high price points.  Staff Commendation The staff during the stay has to be commended on their excellent service and help when issues were discovered. Raymond, Rose and Siti were especially helpful in dealing with the problems encountered in the rooms or elsewhere in the hotel. The stay was definitely a great recharge as we move forward into the New Year.  Final Recommendation Definitely a great hotel to stay at for a short or even long staycation but not for those who prefer brand new hotels or recently refurbished hotels as the rooms here are a bit dated but still functional and comfortable. From the experience of the stay, getting a Normal/Deluxe Room is a better option both financially and stay-enjoyment as the add-ons provided from the extra cost for the Club Rooms are not worth it. Suitable for all types of guests be it Single, Couples, Friend, Family or Business.,…,Location of the hotel is at the heart of Tanjong Pagar. 100AM is just next door with wide variety of shops. Not only that, they have a supermarket at the mall as well as opposite the hotel!  Thank you to Ms Hasmah for the seamless check in and the hospitality. Mr Raymond for interacting with my son and made him a toy balloon, which he appreciated and also enjoyed his stay!  Definitely coming again for another staycation!,Had a wonderful stay at the Amara , Staff was excellent especially Raymond . Lovely person . They also extended my checkout till 5 pm as I had a late flight . Kudos  to the staff  Only complain is the wifi that kept dropping out,Raymond at the conceirge was super helpful and was greatly served bu him for put cake and get information and also for questions we had.

Eric on the front desk was particularly helpful with arranging a room for us despite our early arrival and also organising a late check out for us for our evening flight.  The location is very good for the river trips and Chainatown is in walking distance although my wife found it too hot outside for her liking.  Breakfast selection is very good in a pleasant environment.  We would not hesitate to stay here again and Eric, thanks again.,This hotel is well situated close to Clarke Quay, and a good city base for exploring China town or even for those that like to walk, you can easily walk to the Gardens by the Bay or Raffles hotel. It is clean, staff very friendly, excellent breakfast and has a roof top infinity pool, which is very good. The only downside was our room was not at a higher level, we were just on the 2nd floor and it seemed like the road was just outside. Not necessarily a noise issue, but we had to keep our blinds closed as people could easily see in. Highly recommend for exploring the city.,Good hotel with nice facilities. Staff try very hard to please. Room great. Roof top terrace nice. Unfortunately the pool on the roof was under maintenace during this stay. Breakfast good but not as good as last stay here. Overall good value for money.,Stayed in this hotel for the past week and the one of the front desk staff named Eric, was extremely rude and unhelpful. I was waiting for information about the future procedures from MFA but Eric insisted that I was to check out immediately. He threatened me that he would get the security and police to come and force me to leave. This happened during the coronavirus epidemic, where situation is uncertain, and precautions have to curb the widespread infection. I had two close contacts in UK that had tested positive, and a partner that was waiting for her swab test results. I was a high risk individual. Instead, this hotel staff did not want to wait for the instructions from MFA and rudely chased me out of the hotel. Extremely disgraceful and disappointing","Modern,Mid-range",,,320,42,100

The dressing table was decent and a closet was available for putting in clothes. The room is clean and the bed was firm and nice to sleep on.,This is a budget hotel. You get what you pay for (for Singapore). It was clean. About 15 minutes from 2 MRT stations, with buses near by. The room was quite small (we initially were going to sleep 4 adults in one room but once I saw the room I book a room at the hotel across the street for half the price, FYI). The main thing was the noise level - the walls are paper thin. The main guests of the hotel appear to be mainland Chinese tourists who, culturally, are not quiet in hotels. I don’t expect them to be quiet - but I do expect buildings to be better insulated. There were a few nights we woke up in the middle of the night with arrivals or departures of guests who were not quiet - and the walls have NO insulation. Don’t stay here to rest - stay here as a place to go to and from, the city. Also - note that it is in the red light district. Despite this, it is not “obvious” or dangerous. ,…,Okay, hotel pricing in Singapore is quite expencive compared to other Asia. So we picked this hotel because the price was bit lower than other hotels. Also the pictures looked quite good. But lets be straigth.

Hotel NuVe Stellar,3.0,1 review,#281 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,free wifi was included,Little India,air conditioner,great air conditioning,Pros - Good location, lots of food options and City Square Mall nearby. Free parking, although carpark was tiny (4 lots, with motorbikes taking up some lots) and you had to reverse into the building to park due to the size. Front desk staff were always very polite and friendly. Air conditioning is not centralized, a good thing during covid times. Room & bathroom were generally clean.  Cons - Our room had a very noisy auto door outside and everytime someone walked near it, it sounded like the whole ceiling was about to collapse. Room was worn out, looked like a budget hotel, which is strange for a hotel which opened this year.  Most importantly, we found an airline blanket and eye mask left behind in the wardrobe by the previous guest. This would mean the room probably hosted, quarantine guests before us. Also, quarantine guests were on the same level as us and next to us, as there were empty food packets all over the corridors. Definitely did not feel safe staying there.,…",,,,324,23,100
Somerset Bencoolen,4.0,359 reviews,#119 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Somerset Bencoolen is a group of serviced apartments. We've stayed here twice in a two bedroom two bathroom apartment with our 1 year old daughter and loved it. The apartment is really spacious, well appointed with absolutely everything you'd need. The service is just like you'd get in a hotel with daily maid service, full service reception and breakfast buffet (although the choice is limited compared to a 5 star hotel). The pool area is worth a special mention, it's on the roof and is a really relaxing place to spend time. It's obviously not as luxurious as a 5 star hotel but really really well laid out and beautiful surrounds. There is a children's playground as well and they even provide towels and some toys!  The majority of the clientelle are people on business which means, the pool is pretty much empty, as well as the gym and guest lounge.  The location is just off Bras Basah Road, which becomes Orchard Road. I walk to all the malls on Orchard Road, to the Raffles area and Sun Tec city, Sim Lim square and all of the museums are just down the road. It couldn't be better.   My husband is working in Singapore temporarily and it's great to find somewhere to stay that has high standards just like a hotel but where you can feel like you're at home.  Previously in Singapore we've stayed at Le Meridien (terrible), The Crowne (so so) and Raffles the Plaza (awesome). The only down side is there is a minimum stay of one week and it can be expensive compared to a hotel. But if you are here for more than a few days and particularly if you are travelling with kids, I can't recommend it highly enough. ,…,1. Room: Originally I booked 2 bedroom apartment. Enter the room on 5th floor and I was welcomed by water leaking that floods the floor. Later the management offer one bedroom with connecting door which my family and I accepted. The interior looks tired but still falls on well-maintained category. Cleanliness is top rate. Bedding was good enough for resting. The bedroom itself is sort of small but the main family room is relatively spacious.Too bad, there is no washing machine.  2. Bathrooms: amenities well-provided. Very clean. Shower pressure all good.  3. Kitchen: basic appliances were well-stocked. Fridge / refrigerator found here.  4. Wifi: decent connection  5. Grab Stop: Yes it is not the bus stop, it is the grab stop which is the highlight of this hotel where you can, literally wait for grab after made a booking. If you don’t have smartphone, you can book a grab car by using the grab booking machine near the receptionist. Very convenient.  6. Location: from MRT perspective, this place is pretty much close to all the tourist destination in Singapore. Raffles City Shopping Centre is 10 minutes walking.  7. Breakfast: Continental western buffet breakfast in Asian city? What a real plot twist in Singaporean accomodation. If you are looking for chicken rice, porridge or noodle....better get a breakkie somewhere outside.  In summary, the goodness still outweigh all the badness. Good basecamp for a family group trip.,…,I visited Singapore with my family in April . Somerset 2bhk apartments are really nice and at great location.The staff is also very helpful and cooperative.Thanks and all the best to Somerset team for awesome hospitality .,Great setup for our seven day stay. Stayed in a two bedroom two bathroom room with lounge and kitchen on the fifth floor.  Location excellent, opposite metro and near shops.   Room spotlessly clean. Modern shower in each bathroom plus bath in the ensuite. Kitchen good sized fridge and freezer. Air conditioning worked well .  Continental breakfast a bonus with the extra benefit of a couple of hot dishes. Lovely fresh food and salad items. Not necessarily a huge range but more than adequate. Nice outdoor eating area.  Clean pool with lovely view from the rooftop. Couldn’t get the spa to work ourselves but it did work when staff member tested it.  Staff were a standout feature of the hotel. Always a friendly greeting from the staff at the front desk. Staff happy to answer questions, and assist with transport and sightseeing advice. The two ladies working in the breakfast room were always smiling and kept on top of the restocking the food.  My one suggestion for improvement would be to provide some more shade in the pool area.,…,My family travelled to Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix and we stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (2 bathrooms-the main has a bath) and loved it. There was a fully equipped kitchen which we hardly used as there were plenty of cheap places around to eat. It was a short walk to the MRT (which was easy to use and fabulous) and there were good places to eat nearby. It turned out to be the best place to stay as it was close to everything we needed. We got a discount due to the construction outside (3 of us stayed = $900 AUD each for 7 nights) and the work only woke me up once all week and my room faced the work site. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a buffet breakfast with the usual spread with a large outdoor terrace to eat at or have a cigarette any other time. The, outdoor guest lounge is always open and has a gym and laundry on the same floor. The hotel was very clean and the rooftop pool was an unexpected delight. There is a large pool and pool area for relaxing and a big jacuzzi. We ended up swimming nearly everyday as it was lovely and cool and a great escape from the Singapore heat. The beds were comfortable and excellent air conditioning in all rooms. They lent us an adaptor for our phone chargers. We loved it and I would recommend it as a good place to stay. We will be going back for sure.,…","Mid-range,Centrally Located",,,361,59,100
Pasir Panjang Inn,3.0,33 reviews,#301 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,I would not recommend staying here unless you are doing something with the National University of Singapore, NUS. It is at least 20 minutes from the closest MRT stations, and it’s difficult to catch Taxis out front. The staff were friendly enough, but didn’t go out of their way to help us. The price is definitely reasonable for Singapore, but what you get isn’t that great. All of the hallways smell extremely smoky, and even in our room that is supposed to be non-smoking I could still smell potent smoke. The bathroom shower was peeling, but the room was clean and decently sized. It had a powerful air conditioning which was nice for the hot summer. They give you fresh towels and soap every day, but bring your own shampoo/conditioner. There was a dead cockroach in the stairway that, was never removed. It’s nice there’s breakfast every morning, but it becomes very monotonous. Basically egg, sausage, and toast. The hotel was in a safe location. The building is extremely old though, so just be prepared. I would not stay here again if possible.,…,This is a really old hotel and it’s located along pasir panjang road. If you are attending or visiting NUS, this is a good place to stay.  Other than that, do not expect too much and you would not be disappointed. There’s a number of 24 hrs eateries within a 10 minutes walk and that’s a plus point. From local nasi lemak, to Thai food to Indian food!,Price: We were here during the super peak Lunar New Year period for a week. This was the only hotel in this area that didn't triple their room prices. That means their management is a fair one.  Room: To be really honest, the room wasn't in the best shape. The paint on the bath tub was peeling, and the air-conditioning was the really old, centralized kind that it's always either too hot or too cold, you can't really control it. However, the silver lining was that it was spacious enough (19sqm compared to most other hotels at this price range are 14sqm or less), and for sgd100 in Singapore during a super peak period, we can't complain. Just be wise and bring your own shampoo/conditioner/shower gels. Otherwise, they do provide the good ol' bar of soup and fresh towels, if that's, all you need for a simple shower.  Service: Most of the staff were lovely, probably because they are older and fatherly, and were more than happy to recommend us places to visit and helping us book taxis. Vincent remembered our names and greeted us warmly every other day (because he works every other day), and even showed us his family photos, helping us with the food and baby chairs for our kids. Really sweet guy.  Breakfast: It's always stir-fried bee hoon (thin rice vermicilli) on Tue/Thu/Sat and fried rice on Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun. On top of that, one egg and one sausage, free flow toast, coffee and tea. It's supposed to end at 930am (or 10am on holidays? I can't remember), but they start clearing up by 925am. If you meet the nicer staff, they'll still get you some food. If not, there's always 7/11 nearby.  Location/Food: Most who chose to stay here was for its walking distance to NUS (National University of Singapore), or just a few bus stops away from NUH (National University Hospital), or that that they work in the marine line where they need to visit the ports along Pasir Panjang Road just few minutes away. Having said that, this location is God-send for us because it's hard to find food in most neighbourhoods this time of the year (most Chinese stallowners will be on a break!) but not here! Just a 100 metres walk away is a stretch of eateries and stores --- the Chinese Hong Kong restaurant ran by China Chinese, the two prata shops ran by Malays and Indians, and even the Thai store was open throughout this festive season. We were also thankful that 7-11 was open 24/7 throughout too.   If you're into exploring the less known places in Singapore, steering away from the usual touristy recommendations, here's a fab list that's really close to this hotel (all of them less than 2 kilometres away): - Pasir Panjang Vegetable Wholesale (and the hawker food centre nearby) - Haw Par Villa  - Singapore Yacht Club - NUS LKC Natural History Museum (awesome find!) - Vivocity and the connecting Sentosa, Universal Studios Singapore are indeed touristy, but they're pretty near too, 10-minutes ride away.,…,I went there as I found it to be closest to the university where I had an exam but they stay was not a very pleasant experience as the staff were rather unfriendly especially to foriegners and the breakfast too had limited choices. The rooms were well maintained,Old building, nothing modern. Nice, friendly old people who maintain and run this place. Located close to the university and close to the port. Also has a few south-east asian restaurants around the corner offering some good options along with a 7-Eleven.",,,,29,5,60
Heritage Collection on Clarke Quay,5.0,6 reviews,#131 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,Heritage @ South Bridge is absolutely a hidden gem. The studio has an amazing location with plenty of restaurants and bars around. It is literally located across Boat Quay and a very short walk to Clark Quay. The studio is super clean and it has a small kitchen with its appliances, a fridge, a kettle, a microwave and even a toaster. It has an apple tv and netflix installed and they even provide you with a local mobile phone you can use for free. Another good thing is they also provide you with a washer and a dryer so you could always have clean clothes during your stay. The customer service is superb, Jarwin is very sweet and accomodating and always available whenever you need him. He even brought me mandarin oranges and made sure my stay was comfortable.

Heritage Collection on Chinatown,4.5,29 reviews,#61 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,Interesting setup, and very thoughtful and good factilities. they even give you detergent and dish washer. Got fridge and microwave. Location is convenient.  Cozy room with warm heater showers Room is good and will visit again.,My room was ready around 145pm, but I was unable to reach at that time so it was pushed back to 3pm (standard check-in time). When I arrived, I was a little confused because there were multiple entry points, but there was a lady with short hair who helped me out before Angela arrived. She guided us to our room and walked us through some online forms that we needed to sign. She also taught us how to use the Apple TV. She was very friendly and her replies, along with Mary and Kenneth were very helpful as I have faced an issue with the apple tv (see the picture attached haha). It was not the tv's fault, but just that i pressed something wrongly.  Room wise, it is a small studio apartment with a decently sized bathroom. I really like the room because there is a charger socket beside, the bed, the bed was not too soft (i love harder beds), there was a closet with a good number of hangers, a big fridge, utensils, plates, bowls, dish soap and sponge and even a washing machine and a dryer. The shower heats up pretty fast too. Aircon was cold too (adjustable). Pillows were very thick, love it!  A tiny handful downsides: - the shower had no adjustable wall mount. there is a holder but it is at waist area...  - paint cracks and some yellowish hard build-up, but it didn't really bother us.  - the sink tap was loose, but still usable.  - the table had 2 sockets, but i feel that it was too close to the table such that i couldn't fit my laptop charger because it was just too narrow. my iphone charger faced issues too, so i had to use the socket by the bed. (you can see from the photo i attached, my phone couldn't charge because of the angle of my plug...)   Remember to bring your toothbrush & toothpaste. It isn't provided. Overall, I would give a 4.5/5. Very cosy room.,…,Overall: 9/10 overall ease of checkin, checkout, facility inside the room, small gym & facilities outside room, comfort, toiletries and dishwashing and laundry soap were provided. Bathroom was clean. Didn't need to bring anything except your clothes. left feeling happy and relaxed! Will be back.  Comfort: bed was comfortable, sheets were comfortable and welcoming. Windows and white walls gave an open clean vibe, able to relax easily.  Feedback : cleanliness was there but if we were to be really really picky, don't forget to wipe top of the fridge for dust. There was a tiny brown sauce/stain dot on the bedsheet. The towel for the floor felt abit Sticky probably due to too much softener used. Apple TV couldn't air play.,The stay was cosy and nice, no one to disturb your stay as there is no reception at this place. Great location. Just the access to the different levels without lift was slightly a bad side as we have elderly with us and was tiring to go up and down like this. Room was small but compacted with all the necessary items like washing machine to toaster.. Enjoyed the stay though at first thought that the smell from level 1 will be over whelming but no smell or noise throughout my 3 days stay. Overall was nice and great stay. Thank you.,This is my 2nd time staying. Pleasant experience as the first, with very friendly and accommodating guest manager and also booking staff who were understanding to accede to my request for a change in date of booking due to special circumstances.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore",4.0,"8,386 reviews",#61 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean","Share, ,The ParkRoyal Marina Bay (PRMB) was opened end of last year following a renovation and we dropped by for a 1 nite staycation in May. The hotel was still in their soft opening phase as there are still some areas undergoing renovations such as part of the swimming pool area and the suites.  Checking in was a breeze and a great delight as there is no queue, possibly due to reduced staycation guests as a result of the Phase 2 Heightened Alert. We will also like to commend the PRMB team which has always been prompt in replying our emails prior to the stay and such customer service is what makes the hotel stand out.  The room we purchased was the Signature Marina Bay room, which was supposedly their highest tier room this moment as the suites are still undergoing renovation., Unfortunately the room we were being allocated did not have a direct view of the bay. The bay could only be sighted from an angle at the balcony. Within the room, the direct view was actually overlooking Mandarin Oriental instead.  The room was freshly renovated and adopts a minimalist style. Though the PRMB website stated its room size as 32 square metres, it looked considerably smaller than the rooms of similar grade hotels. Also as it is supposedly a higher tier room, we are expecting a bit more furnishing such as a business desk and chair and probably a one seater sofa.   The in-room fridge was however cleverly designed to be placed at a height where guests could just open the fridge without needing to bend down. One of the most essential items in a hotel room is the bed and the bed at PRMB was of a nice firmness.  The washroom was of a good size where there are also a bathtub, however, the shower cubicle surface area was awkward as there was a pillar that “jagged out” and took up nearly 20% of the cubicle space. Post renovation I was also surprised to see that the shower cubicle does not come with a rain shower which is the norm in hotels nowadays. In addition, the toilet bowl was surprisingly low in height and was not very comfortable for a grown adult, at least myself.  This is my second stay at a ParkRoyal within a 3 months period and it appeared that their chain is switching to filtered water tap instead of providing bottled water. Personally I prefer bottled water as I don’t trust the water quality from filtered water tap as it is largely dependent on how frequent the filter are being changed and also how frequent and intensive is the servicing done on the filtered system hoses.  Though our room does not come with meals, we were given breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés. We are not certain if these were given due to our GHA status (as no room upgrade as ours was already the highest tier available) or if it was given to all room guests due to no dining-in in the in-house restaurants. In any case it was a very kind gesture of the hotel.  Also as our room package was the Feast and Eat one which comes with a $400 credit, it was essentially 6 meals in 1.5 days (including the complimentary evening canapés etc.). While Peach Blossom food was great, Peppermint puts up a strong fight with its lobster laksa and Halibut fish and chips.   There are two areas whereby some tweaking or improvements will be welcomed. Firstly it will be better if Peach Blossom could cover up their dishes with covers or cling wrap them before delivering to the room, especially in a pandemic period. Next, the food items available in the app was far lesser as compared when making a call to the hotline, as such, the hotel could perhaps consider beefing up the ordering menu in the app itself.  Since it was Phase 2 HA we didn’t go around touring the hotel and the only place we went to was the pool. It was of a nice size due to limited visitors but if the hotel will to go back to full capacity, the pool might be too small for personal comfort. We went for a nite swim on the first day of our stay as we heard that there will be “stars” (lights) in the pool but to be honest it did not really awe us very much.  All in all this was a great staycation to relax with lots of movies and food. Should the hotel be ranked solely based on the infrastructure it may not be able to match that offered by its more known competitors but what makes it stand out is its customer service, starting from the front desk to the room service delivery personnel and ending off with the concierge.  Will I revisit again? Definitely yes and very soon in the near future.,…,Hotel is located at Marina Square but the links from the mall are being blocked due to safe management measure. The entrance is through the main lobby and proceed to level 4 for check-in.  The check-in is very smooth and fast. The room is quite big with limited amenities   depending the room and direction, our room is facing the flyer and Marina Sand. Of course the morning view with sun rise. The shower is a bit small and will be a problem of big size guest. The swimming pool and gym are on level 5, but certain areas are underway upgrading.  This has cause the floor to the pool with dust. The pool has  toilets but can't has shower.  The breakfast is okay and they will serve you even though it is buffet style due to SMM.,After reading the reviews, we checked into the Marina Mandarin with some trepidation. However, from the get-go, it was a pleasant experience.   The Desk clerk was extremely polite and upgraded us to a Club Room on the 2nd highest floor. What a view! Contrary to other reviews, we found the room to be extremely well-appointed!  There was an espresso machine in the room with a selection of genuine espresso capsules. This is the first hotel that we've stayed in that had an in-room espresso machine and we've traveled extensively to more than 180 cities worldwide!  The room was tastefully furnished and had a long bath as well as a multi-jet shower stall. I enjoyed the hot multi-jets of water after a long day shopping although the pressure was so high that the drainage could not cope, with the massive output of water - the water sipped out of the shower stall and we had soggy floor mats, which was promptly replaced the next morning!  Service was good but we were denied free internet which was a bummer. In this day and age, one would think that such facilities would have been gratis, especially in Asia!  Compared to the hotels in Europe and the US of A, this hotel though, would take some beating if we factor in the great room rates!!,…,My family and I had the pleasure of staying at the Marina Mandarin last June 2017, and had such a wonderful experience that we stayed again for 2 weeks in April 2018.  I'd firstly like to thank General Manager Melvin Lim and his staff for providing us with exemplary service throughout our stay. From checking in to checking out, the service was faultless and the staff couldn't be more helpful. Check in was extremely quick, the service was extremely friendly and welcoming,  and took only minutes to complete.  My family and I had adjoining rooms on the 10th floor with outstanding views of the Marina Bay area. The rooms are ideal for families, being roomy, comfortable, have excellent amenities, fixtures and fittings, and the complementary smart phone was particularly welcomed.  We, had breakfast included in our stay, and this is highly recommended for anyone staying here. The  service, choice, freshness and availability was excellent and great value for money.  The beautifully presented swimming pool and pool gardens provided an oasis of relaxation for my family. The pool is filled with mineral water and is large and deep, and the surrounding gardens are large with plenty of sun loungers and amazing rooftop views.  The location of the hotel is ideal for accessing the MRT (Esplanade and City Hall are the closest and are only a few minutes walk away).  There are 3 shopping malls close by and within easy air conditioned walking distance - Marina Mall, Suntec City and Raffles City.  Access to Marina Bay is very easy and you will be walking around the bay in 5 minutes from leaving the hotel. It takes around 15 minutes to walk to the Merlion and 20 minutes to walk to Gardens b y the Bay. The Marina Bay Sands hotel and Mall is a 20 minute walk from the hotel.  We must also mention the House Keeping staff, especially the lady who cleaned our rooms. She was very very helpful, always courteous and provided excellent service.  In summary this is the perfect hotel for a stay in Singapore, and we enjoyed our recent stay so much that we will be returning for another 2 weeks next Easter!,…,Stayed there on a stop-over for two nights early February 2006.  Room was spacious, as was the bathroom. All the amneties you would expect in the bathroom, twowel robe, slippers etc. (although a bit small for european feet). Minibar and room service were extremely cheap by comparison to European hotels. Do not try the internet on the inroom TV, though, it flickers and you can hardly read a thing.  Staff was very friendly and helped with arranging tour, luggage storage and delivery.  Only downside was the noise from the street (my room faced Suntec City) and that, due to MRT construction work, the hotel is currently a bit hard to access on foot (cross a six lane street or take a detour through the neighbouring, mazelike shopping mall to get to Suntec City, MRT and busses). The, SIA hop on-hop off leaves just across the street, though, if that is an option for you. ,…","Bay View,Marina View",18632,Official Site,430,57,100

Our Air Con didn't work so a person came and punched buttons and said that it would be fine in ten minutes.  Never.  The hallways were cooler than our room.

Reception hot and run-down; Air con was poor, if existent, carpets stained, wall paper peeling, cockroach baits, grubby amenities... my wife and child started crying.We decided to leave and forfeit the cost of 1 night. It's not a case of ""well, you get what you paid for""! We found a near-new, modern, very cool hotel in a far better district - that had an awesome pool, friendly staff, etc for LESS than what we paid per night for this hotel! So thankful we didn't stay here, as our experience of Singapore would not have been as wonderful as it was for the 3 days we were there, if we had stuck it out. Lesson learned - don't believe the hotels own description!,Great location, just few minute walk to the underground station, very quiet and clean, staff very professional. Good value for money. Rooms are cleaned every day and the housekeepers are very nice and polite.,This hotel is located about four blocks from the rapid transit station.  I should warn travelers that you walk through a male prostitute area during the night.  There are also a number of restaurants and Chinese grocery stores along the way.  The rapid transit station has a bakery and juice shop and we ended up patronizing them every day.,We have travelled a lot but first time to Singapore. If you are looking for a low budget,very clean hotel,look no further.

This includes all staff members.We will see you all again next year. Jan and I(Trevor) thank you all for the great time we had with you all.See you next year.,This hotel is a great choice when all you want is somewhere to stay. Singapore has plenty of choices for eating out, why eat at your hotel? Why pay for stuff you don't need. At the hotel 34 you get a clean room, clean bathroom/shower, and a vending machine with drinks, and free WiFi. And that's it!. Also, the staff at the front desk are friendly. It's around 10 minutes walk from Aljunied MRT (depending how fast you walk), buses are not far away either. I stayed here in 2015 and am staying again very soon. People say Singapore is expensive. No it's not, if you don't waste money on accommodation. And no, you don't have to stay in ""those"" sort of places to save money. This one is perfectly fine.",,,,54,4,73
Atlantis Pods @ Chinatown,4.0,23 reviews,#125 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,This hostel is very bad, the place constantly smells of Indian food, bathrooms are dirty. The breakfast is very basic and is located in a dirty narrow space located at the reception area. I have never in my entire life witnessed a hostel cleaner cleaning the hostel making a loud noise at 1.30am in the morning. When I questioned why the cleaner was cleaning at such an ridiculous hour he replied that’s what the boss wants.,We liked our stay at Atlantis Pods Chinatown. The location was perfect, in the heart of Chinatown and very close to the MRT. The spacepod itself is a fun idea and we liked the extra privacy, however they are not at all soundproof from the hallway or other pods. Depending on what price you pay for the pod, you may have one that is right beside the front desk and get a lot of noise from people walking through.  Some comments: The hostel has a really strong fragrance smell upon entering. The bathrooms are small and generally pretty dirty and wet. The pods are given a surface clean between people, but you can see lots of accumulated dust in the corners and crevices. The pods are not soundproof. There was a person diagonal from my pod who snored very loudly and I could hear it very, clearly. Front desk staff is only there sporadically. There is very little space to sit outside the pods, so in general you are either out of the hostel or in your pod, no comfortable seating area.,…,Perfect location close to the MRT station, hawker centres, &7 Eleven, souvenir shops, MC Donalds, ATM. Good budget hostel in Singapore. Great nightlife vibe also. I will come back to stay here. You can join the Free Walking tour by Monster Day Tours too.,I've stay only 1 nights, and not required many things. But just a complain about power charge, it too slow and make harm for battery devices. Anyway, the place is so easy to find place & nearly the MRT station.,I’ve stayed in pod hostels before, but none as bad as this and if you want a chance of sleep, don’t go here. The location is brilliant, right in the heart of Chinatown but the accommodation is awful. On arrival, there was nobody at reception and no answer on the contact number left, which after a 12 hour flight meant I had to sit around for another 45 minutes waiting for somebody to show up.   For anybody who has or hasn’t stayed in a hostel before knows to expect noise. We all want a peaceful nights sleep but with travellers coming and going, it won’t be like that. however,  I don’t expect the owner to be sat at his desk right next to the pods, watching films through computer speakers until 2 in the morning. Give me a fighting chance of sleep!   I ended up checking out early, and staying somewhere else,…",,,,771,123,100
Hotel 81 Fuji,2.5,17 reviews,#315 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,I stay 2 nights with this hotel for liesure purpose in singapore. When i reach the lobby the girl at the reception looks at me like I'm a killer even to say a light greetings nothing, anyway i understand this is a budget hotel however just a bit hospitality service must be provided to the guest as they are doing hospitality business. On the second night of my stay, after i reach in my room i notice that no water has been place in the room i called the reception and requested on it however the reception KENNY answer me back that i need to go down and collect it from the lobby..it is very disappointed that this small request also they can't provide? Compare to the other hotel 81 branch this hotel 81 fuji is in need of training for your staff.!,Visited this hotel on June 2014 for family trip. First of all they have very friendly staffs especially the morning staff. The hotel is very close to the bus station and also near 7eleven and Cheers. The room is clean and the bathroom also clean. Free wi-fi and my room have TV. Overall nice stayed at Hotel 81 Fuji,a very strange hotel.  Stay 3 nights. It looks ok when you walk in, the staff are not helpful or friendly. The room is small, dirty, cigarette burns in sheets, bed and furniture. Shower and toilet leaked. The whole of 6 floor smelled of cigarette smoke even though it's a non smoking hotel.   Got woken up at 3am by prostitutes all down the corridor with their high heels and door slamming.   We was waiting downstairs in the afternoon  and so many Men got a room for just 2 hours for the room with 'ladies' it's seedy   ,This is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. It cost US $116 for one night, but it should probably be more like $30, its a piece of crap! Thw WHOLE hotel, from the moment you walk in reeks of cigarettes, even with it being a non smoking hotel supposedly. Our rooms smells like cigarettes, its very dirty, looks nothing like the pictures. The bathroom is filthy, the bathtub is stained and the toilet seems it hasn't been cleaned in a while. We were in a pinch so settled for this for one night but i would suggest paying more for something better. The staff is also not very friendly for being in the customer service field. ,Even though I never stayed in this area before, it is pretty good. The hotel itself is next to two convenience stores and there are a lot of restaurants nearby. It is also easy to get to Orchard/Bugis/Chinatown.  However, location is probably the only good thing about the hotel. When I told my taxi driver my destination, he said, ""Go straight to your room after you check-in, don't linger around. Funny business."" Well, apparently this a love hotel.  I stayed here for three nights and these are what I felt:  1. The whole hotel reeks of cigarette smell even though there is a no-smoking sign.  2. The corridor of 4th floor has some wet patches.  3. Shower leaks when you turn it on.  4. I woke up to wet floor in my room.  5. The AC was still super cold even when I set it at 30.  All, in all, this might be a good place if you only need it for couples of hours. Definitely not recommend it for travellers. ,…",Mid-range,,,60,2,80
D'Resort at Downtown East,4.0,772 reviews,#107 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid private parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,All was expected at D’resort. It was our fourth time there. Except we were missing a safe in the room. That would have been super inconvenient if my father didn’t have another room (where we deposited our passports and stuff). So, make sure you request for the things you need beforehand so they can assign you to the correct room. We have always had a safe in our room. Except for the fourth time. We enjoyed the location as it is very near Downtown Resort which has some really good food and convenient to  walk to. My girls enjoyed the waterpark twice as they loved all the thrilling slides which allowed them multiple entry within a day (remember to get your hands stamped for that to happen when you exit).,We stayed for one night before flying home.  We had a large family room, which was clean and comfortable.  It was really close to a great waterpark (which we got free tickets for) and to a shopping mall.  It was in a good location for the airport.,Warm reception, well located, easy access via public teansport and close by majoy shopping mall food outlet, fun Wild Wild Wet,  area are well kept clean, Excellent environment for relax stay away from city.,This hotel has no bar!   The hotel building is about 200m from a mall that I presume is part of the same development around the water park. There are bars there but they’re “theme bars” at best. Fancy a gin and tonic or glass of wine before heading back to your room? Nice! Well, it’s 200m to the mall where there’s a loud live music bar, a scary looking pool/billiards bar and oddly a darts bar. Tried 2 of the 3 and none would sell spirits or wine unless you buy a whole bottle. So unless you fancy a bottle of Scotch before bedtime you’re out of luck. The hotel reception room was massive. Just put a bar on one of the end walls!  There’s a 7/11 type shop and an uninviting cafe in the hotel so if they don’t float your boat for breakfast, you’re off to the mall 200m away.  It wasn’t, all bad. Rooms are nice, beds comfortable and the nearby park is lovely with a fascinating mangrove with boardwalk.  Would I stay here again? Not a chance when Singapore has so many options to choose from.,…,The room were great. Had a good sea side view and great service. Very good location , not a busy area with a mall connected to the resort. Also close by the airport . You can use MRT to go towards city or actually any area you like to visit MRT is very handy. Free shuttle bus service from mall to MRT station.  The resort is also linked to Wild Wild Wet which was great for everyone. Lots of different rides and family fan time walking distance from any of your rooms. Resort also have a camping site by the sea side area which was great. Take your BBQ stuff as the resort has great spots just behind rooms for a great BBQ time. Lots of shops in the mall for any shopping. Halal McDonald's and KFC also inside the mall with other lots of restaurants. ","Family Resort,Family",,,40,5,75
Beary Best! Hostel Kampong Glam,4.5,41 reviews,#6 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,I only spent one night there, but I had a good experience. It was an easy check-in/check out, the price is very inexpensive, and the beds were pretty comfortable. It was nice and quiet in the rooms too, despite their being many beds in the room. Each bed has a curtain to give you privacy too. It has everything you need (towels, shower shoes, soap/shampoo, electrical outlet by the bed). I recommend it whether you're solo or not alone, unless you don't like sharing a space with others.,They have a 24 hour customer help service on the phone (whatsapp and another app) that provide help whenever needed with fast response times. There is no common area for food, but its location is great on Arab Street and close to Bugis. The rooftop chilling area is nice too, where you can soak in both the Singaporean tall buildings and the rooftops of cultural streets below.,Went there on december 2019, the check in was easy, staff are really helpful. Room was really clean, beds are comfy. They also have a great balcony on upstairs. Location is great, near to bugis, mrt station, and bus stop. Definitely go back when i go to singapore,My stay at Beary Best! Hostel in Kampong Glam, Singapore was excellent and relaxing. Check-in was easy and seamless, while the lady at the front desk was very welcoming, courteous and helpful. The overall ambience and vibes were very laid-back & chill. There is not much of a common-area so to speak, though there is a lovely roof-top lounge area with scenic views of the surrounding area, Arab Street and the stunning Masjid Sultan.  At night it was a great place to hang out and meet new people. The dorm rooms were kept very clean and the capsule bunks were comfortable and cozy with outlets and privacy curtains. The lockers to keep your bags and belongings were big and spacious, and were perfect for a backpacker like myself. The showers and toilets were equally as clean and in kept, in good order. The front-door is 24-7 and you are given a passcode to punch in on the key-pad outside to access the hostel anytime. Location-wise, it is a good one. Right on Arab Street within walking distance to the Bugis MRT subway station. The neighborhood is a lovely one, with plenty of shops, food, cafes and bars to frequent...If you are looking for a relaxing, easy-going, comfortable and quality hostel in Singapore, I highly recommend this one for sure! ,…,I stayed here February 2020 It was a very nice place, with friendly people working there. The place is central, and you can walk to many boutiques and restaurants. Especially on the evenings, you are happy to stay near to everything, Live 3 minutes walk from Live music restaurants, and other soft things.",,,,484,80,100
Snooze Inn Dickson Road,3.0,7 reviews,#227 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Hi everyone, this is my experience. Cheap customer service and management from above. I seriously suggest to avoid this business because it's not able to meet a rewarding relation between quality and price.,My family and I stayed here and absolutely loved it! Lady and the staff here were especially accommodating - organising taxis and transport for us; plus recommending things to do whilst we were in town. The place was in the perfect location so easy to walk to the city centre or the train station. Will definitely come back!!!! ,Well located, really nice staff for everything, including informations. Bed was comfortable, good shower, breakfast simple but ok. The 2 biggest problems are the travellers who don't respect the sharing room after 23h00 (need a corfu or to be advise) and the room on the street side with a restaurant open 24/24, are to to noisy. You just get little sleep. Coming from Airport, with MRT get off at Jelan Besar exit B, turn right, walk to Dickson Road. To take the bus via Malaysia, walk via Jelan Besar, turn left and right on Weld Road, it will be on your right (3.5MYR),Pros= Very near MRT Station Rochor Mattress of good quality, we sleep soundly after a very tiring day  There is mamak indian restaurant to it which comes handy if u need a quick bite however this can also be the source of noise.  We take ensuite dorm-style room. Toilet is satisfactorily clean. No complaint.  Hot shower available with good water pressure.  Aircond works well,which is worth to mention because Singapore can be very hot especially in the day  Cons= Wall not very sound proof Some of the plugs in the room not working  Tips: You need to tell front desk if you want to check in early-subject to availability  If you pay by credit card there is 3% service charge.  The hotel takes 10sgd deposit per room key Breakfast is bread, butter, jam, tea and coffee. Dont expect too, much.  Can request to borrow Singapore simcard.

J8 Hotel,3.5,477 reviews,#5 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,I have booking ""no window room"".But   i have free upgrade to window room. Basic essentials amenities were provided in the room. Walk to lavender station about 10 minutes.Free minibar ,but 1 plug only for charge your electronic divices. Small toilet but ok. Recommend for budget traveller! Reasonale price.,Currently staying at this hotel.   First night only and already have these problems:  1. Found our room unmade when we returned to the room at 10pm on the second night - as the chambermaids were already off duty, the reception could only provide towels (and I had to request for the trash to be taken out as well)  2. Kettle broken  3. Requested a fork but was asked to make our way down to the cafe to get one instead   At a rate of nearly SGD 150 a night, you would expect a decent level of service / comfort.   Flip side,  1. Good location (extremely accessible to Farrer Park station on the north east line)  2. Not as small as what others make out to be  3. interior is rather new   Slightly disappointing - hope that our following nights here will be better :),The hotel was good and clean. Small rooms but not bad if you're mostly out sightseeing. My problem was that we were on the second floor facing a road which was noisy until after midnight and add to that talkative people in the hall. When I asked about the higher floors, he said that I had only paid for the lowest level room. However, I booked a deluxe gold with window which was the second highest category.  Their site should explain the room categories better.,I did a lot of research on the hotels in Singapore. Although Singapore in general is a cheap vacation spot, the hotels are incredibly expensive. After days of research on multiple sites, the J8 was the best quality hotel for the price of nearly $100/night, believe me when I say that!  We reserved two rooms, one was the Delux Silver for $89, which was small like everyone says.. no room for suitcases, but it had a small balcony. The bathroom was like some you see where the shower head is literally sitting above the toilet and sink. My friends didn't seem to mind, but that would drive me nuts.  My husband and I reserved the Delux Gold room with a window for $106/night. There was plenty of room for the suitcases and the bathroom was more... normal. The toilet didn't get wet while, showering anyway. We booked on Agoda.com. The rooms came with a safe and a frige, and the housekeeping was great. Breakfast was not bad at all, actually. We really can't complain about a thing. We even needed to check in 6 hours early, and paid a small fee to be able to do so :)  We were rarely in the hotel, just to sleep, so it worked perfect. The staff was friendly. Be sure to grab a map of the hotel's location and address for taxi purposes, they are located at the front desk.   There was a subway MRT in the basement of City Park Mall floor B2 and from there you can access Little India and China Town, and Clark Quay easily! Also just one switch to make it to Sentosa Island. The food surround the hotel was fabulous and cheap. I am missing it already. The mall was a 7-10 minute walk from the hotel.  Goodluck, please post questions if you have any, we would love for someone else to enjoy their vacation as much as we did.,…,If all you need is a bed to sleep in and a shower,  then fine book this place.  The room is adequate...  But if you have luggage be prepared to trip over it if it's more than carry on (hand luggage).  The rooms are probably the size of small cruise ship cabins,  some with Windows,  but nonetheless tiny.    Pros: GREAT location for food.  Close to MTA.  Price is quite nice for Singapore   Cons: besides the room being small,  Housekeeping was only in from 0900-1730. If you did not set your light to ""clean room""  it wouldn't be touched.  After hours service is quite limited.  Breakfast (which was included in room package)  wasn't that great  - forego that and explore the city for breakfast instead.    Tips: room with Windows looks bigger and brighter in person.  Not Too bad just, small quarters.  ,…","Modern,Centrally Located",5771,ZenHotels.com,316,19,100

Pan Pacific Singapore,4.5,"11,353 reviews",#15 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,The LOUNGE:  Stunning view and I just love it!  The STAFF: From their ‘backend’ reservation to their concierge, front of house, everyone… I can’t recall their names but I know Jane for sure  basically every one of the staff at PAN PACIFIC are just nice, customer oriented, friendly indeed, all smiley and welcoming!! Even the staff at their pool…!  Room: Gorgeous rooms, size and definitely worth the money you’ll spend there!!  Been there twice or thrice can’t recall but will definitely be back for sure!!!   Pool: Guys with family, NOT TO WORRY cause they provide float for ur kids.   First come first serve though. 😊  Definitely a family oriented hotel!! They do have slides, a playground area, some other kids play area as well… And I really love how convenient it is connected to a, mall!!  Your return customer and WILL BE BACK!!,…,After having a fantastic stay at the Pan Pacific on our last trip to Singapore, we decided to come back for our honeymoon. Our stay was once again wonderful, with amenities, food and service of an excellent standard.  Service: The staff are attentive, welcoming and helpful. Our check in was efficient and personalised, straight away making us feel welcome. The staff at concierge were knowledgable, and likewise, the staff servicing the amenities were always ready to greet us and assist. Up in the club lounge, the staff are exceptionally pleasant, ensuring we had plenty of food and drinks throughout our visits.   Room: We stayed in a Pacific Harbour Studio, and it was absolutely worth every dollar. The view was spectacular, and the room itself was spacious, allowing us ample space, to relax and enjoy our stay. This room has a separate bedroom and lounge area, with sliding walls separating the large bathroom and dressing area. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing - complete with a ceiling rain shower, two angled standard shower heads, a bench seat, and most importantly - excellent water pressure. There was also a separate bathtub, equipped to fit two people side by side. The room was modern, clean and relaxing.  Food: The food at the hotel is excellent, we had no complaints or problems with anything during out stay. We especially enjoyed having breakfast in the club lounge, where it was quiet and relaxing. We did also dine at Keyaki for dinner, which I highly recommend.   Amenities: We used the swimming pool and the spa on our visit, and both were fantastic. The experience at the spa was welcoming and relaxing, and the therapists were excellent at their services.  Location: The hotel is located quite close to most things - it is right next door to Marina Square Shopping Centre (who have an excellent food court upstairs), and the convention centre, and walking distance to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. We also walked to Clarke Quay with no issues either. The Zoo and Night Safari cost us approximately $18 each way by taxi, which was very convenient for us too.   We will definitely be returning to the Pan Pacific Singapore on our next trip out here.,…,We stayed for 8 days/7 nights at the Pan Pacific Hotel in downtown Singapore in March 2006. It was our first trip to Singapore, so we did not know what to expect. Thankfully, we enjoyed our stay very much. We checked in to our hotel on the 20th floor, a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. It was nice, spacious, and very clean.  The best thing about the hotel is its easy access to public transportation. To get from the hotel to the City Hall MRT (train) station, you don't even need to walk outside, just through air-conditioned malls and walkways. The MRT takes you almost everywhere you could want to go, although for some of the more far-out places (like the Zoo or Bird Park), a cab is quite cheap and is easy to get from the front of the hotel. We took a cab from the hotel to, the airport in the early morning and it only cost S$14.  The Pan Pacific is located in the Marina Square Mall. If you love shopping, there are two other malls all within walking distance and connected to each other (Suntec City Mall and Raffles City Mall). Make sure to visit the Fountain of Wealth in the Suntec City Mall and follow the ritual! Also, take advantage of the many money changers in the mall. Try to get small bills if you can ($5 and smaller) to use for train fare as change is limited to $4.  The hotel is very centrally located to everything. It is walking distance to museums, malls, the Esplanade performing arts center, famous Merlion, Clarke Quay (pronouced ""kee"" for all us clueless Americans ;), riverboats, restaurants, and more. So very convenient.  The hotel is beautiful, with glass elevators on both the inside and outside. Take the outside elevators all the way up to the 37th floor - the restaurant floor - for an exquisite view of the city. On the fourth floor of the hotel is a pool (which looked very nice but we did not use) with an outdoor bar and a gym (also very nice but they apparently do not have water so bring your own).  Our only complaint was the loud music from the hotel bar, which was only made worse by the hotel's beautiful atrium design. The music kept going even past midnight, which surprised us because the other reviews here seemed to indicate that the bar music stopped earlier. If you are a light sleeper, or a business traveler who has to go to bed early to wake up early, you might not want to stay here. We are incredulous that management would allow music that loud to be played that late. It did not bother me as I am a pretty fast sleeper, but I woke up one day to find that my boyfriend had stuffed a towel under the door to try to minimize the sound! :(  We did not find the front desk or the concierge very helpful or particularly attentive. Our room was prepaid but they tried to charge us again for some reason even though we brought the print-out receipt so be careful! As for the concierge...bring a guide book or buy one in Singapore! While maps are readily available for free at all visitors' centre, a good guide book is a must. Despite all of that, we found that our calls to their help line, ServiceOne, for wake-up calls were met with great friendliness and professionalism by Sue. Our room was impeccable, with a nice bathroom (separate shower and tub and toilet) and nice amenities. Bottles of water are provided daily, as are a free electric hotpot and instant coffee and tea packets. Very nice to start the day off with coffee and a free copy of the Straits Times! Internet access is only provided free if you upgrade to an executive floor. Otherwise, it is S$10.50 for one hour and is also offered at a lower rate for 6 hours or 24 hours. This charge seemed to me to be quite unnecessary as it was wireless anyway, and I would guess that many of their travelers are business travelers, due to its proximity to the Convention Center. Oh well.  We prefer to eat outside of the hotel on trips, and so cannot rate the bar or restaurants.  Finally, a word of caution. There is some construction going on somewhat near the hotel--the building of yet another train station. This construction is outside of Suntec City Mall and in my opinion is not close enough to be a noise problem. However, we felt that walking around in that area was pretty difficult, given the road closures. You can, of course, take alternate routes. We only walked around there one time, to go to visit the Raffles Hotel.  All in all, the hotel is very nice. If we visit Singapore again, we would most likely try something else as there are a lot of hotel options to be had. However, the Pan Pacific is worth a first visit. We hope you have a wonderful time in Singapore! ,…,I was here for a Dinner & Dance function organized by our Police Land Division. I was impressed with the cozy and well-decorated layout of the hotel lobby and atrium. Just from the outlook and intricate design of the atrium, one must admit that this is a 5-star hotel.   Our Dinner and Dance was held at one of the ballrooms. The space for the cocktail reception was quite limited. There were instant photo booths and game machines to entertain the officers and the limited space appeared packed and crowded.   The ballroom was quite large and the stage was central. The sound system was excellent. The food was sumptuous. The Chinese set of menu comprised the following dishes:  (a)   Combination of deluxe appetizers (Vietnamese Spring Rolls, etc) (b)   Braised seafood with Shredded Sea, Whelk (c)   Crab meat and Sea Cucumber (d)   Roasted Chicken with Crispy Minced Garlic (e)   Steamed Sea Bass in with Chef's Special Sauce (f)    Deep fried Prawns with Wasabi Mayo (g)   Braised Fresh Mushrooms and Shimeiji Mushrooms with Spinach  (h)   Seafood Fried Rice with Silver Fish and Tobico (i)    Chilled Cream of Mango with Sago  The Shredded Sea Whelk, crab meat and sea cucumber soup was very nourishing with rich ingredients. The Steamed Sea Bass was fresh, soft and tender. The Deep fried Prawns tasted well with the wasabi. The Shimeiji Mushrooms was easy to swallow as it was well-cooked and soft. The Seafood Fried Rice tasted fragrant with many rich ingredients: egg, silver fish and tobico seem better than Yang Zhou Fried Rice.   Service was prompt in clearing our plates and topping up our drinks. I understand from the organizing committee that one table costs about $820/- but this price in a 5 star hotel with such delicious food is reasonable. The Master of Ceremony was a comedian and with his humorous jokes coupled with such delicious and sumptuous dinner, I really enjoyed the whole night at the ballroom and you hear laughter rocked the whole ballroom.   Great Place! Good Food! Worthwhile dinner and dance!,…,Gym / Fitness Facilities Review  This review is primarily designed to provide some details on the fitness facilities available at the Pan Pacific - specifically the outdoor swimming pool, gym, and some nearby running routes. There are also two outdoor tennis courts available but I'm afraid I don't play tennis so I can't really comment further on these. It's quite detailed because I have spent a bit of time at this hotel over the last few years and fitness stuff is important to me. I find it can be difficult to get details about equipment etc. available at hotels from their own websites, and if you travel a lot it can help to know details of what's available to plan workouts.  Overview   The pool and gym facilities are located on Level 4. Access to the gym is available 24 hours a, day directly from the hotel interior through a door close to the lifts by using your room keycard. There is also a door that leads out directly from the gym to the exterior and on to the pool, however access through this route is only available between 06.30 to 23.00. There are toilet facilities directly opposite the exterior gym entrance, and male and female changing rooms with showers / steam room further round by the pool attendant area. There are some small lockers in the gym itself, (for instance if you want to put room key / mobile away whilst using the equipment), and larger lockers in the pool changing room if you bring down a change of clothing. The small lockers in the gym have the key in them, and you can get keys for the larger lockers in the pool changing rooms from the pool attendants. There is shampoo / conditioner, shower gel and large towels in the main changing room / showers, so no need to bring that stuff down from your room. Generally I just come down from my room in gym gear and this doesn't seem to cause any offence in the lifts etc., (although it helps if you bring two sets of gym clothing and wash a set each day after use!)   Pool   The outdoor pool is an unusual asymmetric circular design. It is probably easier to look at some of the photos available via the hotel website than it is to describe - but I'll try anyway. Effectively it is two different diameter semi-circular pools joined at a broad, short isthmus with the smaller semi-circle being the deeper half, (2.0m depth). The depth in the larger, shallower half actually varies, being only approximately 3 feet deep at the sides, but dipping down in the centre to a more reasonable depth. I find you can fit in a reasonably length in the shallow side swimming along the straight edged wall where the pools 'join'. I'd estimate a length at around 20 metres here. Because the pool is shallow at the edges a racing flip would be out of the question, (however this suits me as I can't do a racing turn to save myself anyway).  The pool is open from about 06.00 to 23.00 and shaded from direct sunlight in the mornings by the hotel structure. I think the sun hits the pool around midday. The air temperature in S'pore never dips much below high 20's Celsius, (85-90 Fahrenheit), so it's plenty warm whatever time of day or night you go for a swim. Mornings tend to be quieter for laps anyway as guests tend to filter down in the afternoon. As an aside, the poolside area has plenty of loungers many of which can easily be positioned to avoid direct sun exposure as there is a solid covering walkway that runs around the side of the pool. This is great if you have fair skin like me but like to lie outside in the warmth and avoid burning.  Gym  The room is roughly rectangular with one long and one short side being made up of near floor to ceiling slightly tinted windows. This allows for a nice natural light into the gym supplemented by various up and down lights without being too bright. It also allows for a view outdoors when exercising, particularly on the aerobic equipment that all faces outwards onto a view of a decked area with landscaped greenery and flower boxes with ferns and orchids. Although there is an outdoor restaurant just along from the gym, the walkway doesn’t seem to get high traffic and generally the gym has quite a nice private feel to it. The space is air-conditioned and temperature always seems about right to me. Flooring throughout is good quality 'Pavigym' and there are long length mirrors down near the free weights. There is a large flat screen TV on the far wall and a clock (no second hand). Usually there is some 'energy' type music playing that can seem slightly loud at times if in on your own.   There is not always an attendant present in the gym however at 'peak' times there is generally a staff member present. In terms of busy-ness I am frequently the only person in the gym and I think the busiest I have ever seen it was probably around 6-8 persons, i.e. not very busy. I guess this may vary depending on hotel clientele, however I have stayed generally for a week to 10 days over the last 3 or 4 years and it never really seems that busy in the gym. Bottled water is freely available as well as ‘sweat’ towels.   There is a range of equipment most of which is supplied by Technogym. On the aerobic side this includes treadmills with incline / speed adjustments; cross-trainers; static cycles, (both incline and 'normal' cycling posture); a 'hand' cycle; and a 'stair-climber'. These are from the Technogym Excite range and have individual flat screen TV's to display speed / distance stats etc., as well as allowing you to watch various TV channels if you wish. You can also monitor heart rate if you have a compatible heart rate strap, (Polar), which gives some additional exercise options based on HRM'ing. Weights and units are set in metric.  On the weight side there are both free weights and several of the specific exercise wire-type stations with adjustable weights. Free weights range from 1kg to 10kg in 1kg increments, and 12kg to 22kg in 2kg increments. There are a couple of adjustable benches to use for the free weights, (lie-flat to 90 degree adjustable bench seats) as well as a specific ‘crunch’ bench and a back extension ‘bench’. There is a 'Radiant' posture exercises machine and a ‘Multipower’ machine for squats / bench presses with various weight ranges available.   The gym and equipment has always looked very clean over my visits over many years, (immaculate actually), and generally appears well maintained.  Itemized list of gym equipment  Treadmills * 4 (incline / speed adjustment) Step Machine * 1  Hand Cycle * 1 Cross trainers * 2 Stationary Cycle (recline position) * 2 Stationary Cycle (upright position) * 1  Leg Extension Station Leg Curl Station Chest Press Station Vertical Traction Station Abdominal Crunch Station Vertical Traction Station Flexibility (‘posterior’) Station Flexibility (‘anterior’) Station  ‘Radiant’ Posture Exercises Machine ‘Multipower’ Machine  Free weights – 1-10kg (1kg increments); 12-22kg (2kg increments) Abdominal Crunch Bench Back Extension Bench Adjustable (lie-flat to 90 degree) bench / seats * 2 Various exercise mats  Finally there is a small first aid kit in the gym and a larger kit, including an ‘Automated External Defibrillator’ at the attendants’ station at the pool.   Running Routes Close By  The hotel is in the Marina Bay area and there are some good running routes close by. A map and details of these can be found if you Google ‘Marina Bay Running Trails’, which shows three trails at 3.5km, (‘Marina Bay Circuit’), 6km, (‘Singapore River’), and 9.5km (‘Kallang River’). They all pass across ‘The Helix’ bridge that you can see from the hotel if you look toward the Sands Hotel / casino, so you can combine them to create a variety of distances.  A bonus of the ‘Kallang River’ route is that you can run on the Formula One circuit past the main stand / pit lanes at one point for a short stretch – somewhat slower than I suspect folk generally travel there though! The easiest way to get to and from the running routes I have found is the exit from the hotel on Level 2 that takes you onto a walkway that runs down the side of the hotel and over an overpass for Raffles Blvd, then down the side of the Mandarin Oriental onto Raffles Avenue. It only takes about 5 minutes jogging to get to the Helix Bridge and then onto the running routes. Be warned, running it the heat / humidity is not easy if you are not used to it, and it is essential to know you limits and stick well within them. Carrying some water is a good idea too. There are toilet facilities available on all the three routes.   Summary  Hotel gym facilities often get overlooked in reviews and if you are keen on maintaining fitness whilst travelling I hope you find the above details useful. The gym isn’t the only reason I like the Pan Pacific – it is a great hotel for many other reasons too – but overall I would rate the fitness facilities available here in comparison with other similar standards of hotel very highly.,…","City View,Business",,,427,53,100
Swissotel The Stamford Singapore,4.0,"10,254 reviews",#68 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,The hotel is very well located, near very interesting walks and museums.  My room was on the 23rd floor.  It was spacious and with a beautiful terrace from which to see the city.  From the hotel you can access a shopping center.  The staff is correct although not especially friendly.,Thank to Mrs Eddy Tan, Director of Guest Relations / Concierge Services Swissôtel The Stamford. We got a good celebration of Singapore National Day! Most of the great view from room and celebration picture can refer to the many photo post here by me.   The Hotel arrange for few person dress in 1930-1950 style, issue out small National Day gift, and there are games/balloon for the kids to enjoy with, creative idea that made guess engage on this special day!   We saw Mr Marcus Hanna, General Manager and Ms Jacqueline Poey, Hotel Manager , both station themself at the centre of the lobby , with Eddy, to welcome guest and greet them.  The GM was friendly and pass us the name card for future reference. If a Hotel got high mangaement leadership willing to walk the ground and, experience themeself the operation from all corner, you can be sure this hotel is doing very well.   My mother is on wheelchair, so it is best to arrange a hotel for her to enjoy the celebration at the comfort from the rooms, and she truely apprecaite the helpfulness of the hotel staffs too. We will like to thank the telephone operator who answer our call and fulfill our few requests , wiithin a very short timing, good service. For the staffs who after our party over, clean up the area and enable the room is as good as new , before we can rest for the nights, very professional service & well train.   Believe F1 night race on Sept , all visitors from all around the world will experience this unique hotel again, also , her good customer service!   Thank Team Swissotel for the Great Singapore National Day memory 2019!,…,I came here to attend the Junior Officers' Mess 53rd Dinner & Dance. The Guest of Honor was our Commissioner of Police. The event was held at the Fairmont Ballroom.   Guests were to be seated at 7.15 pm and we had our foyer activities and cocktail reception before the actual commencement of the event. There was free flow of soft drinks and beer.   Last year, I came here for my retirement dinner and I had the Chinese menu. This time I sat with my Muslim colleagues and had the Muslim menu. The dishes as follows:  (a)  Deluxe Seafood Appetizer Platter Chicken Satay Goreng, Spicy Prawn with chili Padi crabstick and baby octupus (b)  Stir Fried Scallops & Fresh Shitake Mushrooms with seasoned vegetables (c)  Clear chicken soup & Chicken meat with carrot, onion, lime leaves,, lemongrass & slice coriander (d) Braised chicken in coconut milk with Green Chilli & Fresh shallots (e) Fried Garoupa topped with mild chili sambal and tomato sauce (f)  Wok Braised Squid in spicy Tumeric Gravy with Coriander (g) Nasi Bryani, Basmati rice with Pandan leaves and traditional spices (h) Pomelo with Mango and Sago  The Muslim delicacies were packed with a lot of spices and hot chili stuff. It was very much the local taste. The fried Garoupa was very crispy and the meat delicious but was just a bit hard to cut it up. The stir fried scallops with mushrooms and vegetables appear to me more of a nourishing Chinese cuisine and it is the only dish with little spice and chili. I like the fried yam rolls in the Deluxe seafood dish.   The Nasi Bryani with Basmati rice was very fragrant and sprinkled with cashew nuts and raisins and is one of the best nasi bryani I ever tasted locally. The pepper hot braised chicken in coconut milk invigorated my digestive system and like the spicy hot feel. The dessert of Pomelo with mango and sago were thick with ingredients and not too sweet. The wok braised squid is a bit too much and ended up a lot of leftover, felt a bit wasteful as the waiter took the half full plate of squid away to dispose.   I still prefer the Chinese delicacies of braised fish maw and roasted chicken and the Five Happiness combination cold dish.   I understand that the cost of one table is $600/-.  The food is sumptuous and the ambiance conducive. There were more than 90 tables and the ballroom was spacious enough to accommodate such a big crowd. The sound system is perfect and the side screen images were very clear. The waiters and waitresses were not very experienced but were doing their best.   It was a relaxing dinner and dance. Delicious food, good entertainment programs, free flow of beer, tea, soft drinks and wine. It was a wonderful dinner and dance.,…,This hotel is owned by Raffles International, who also own the one and only Raffles Hotel Singapore, along with sister hotel to the Stamford, The Raffles Plaza. Sadly, the Swissotel does not live up to the and reputation created by it's relatively new owners. In fact if anyone from 'Raffles Holdings' stayed in any of the rooms below the 38th floor, I think that they would be very embarrased indeed!  Once tallest hotel in Asia, the rooms are certainly that. No-one can say that they don't have great views! Which is just as well, as the the hotel seems to be split into two halves.  Get a room on the 38th floor and above and you will have spectacular views, along with a 'refreshed' room. New carpets, curtains, soft furnishings and beds with white duvets, along with new look and more, mordern bathrooms, make for a pleasant stay. Below the 38th floor and your in for a diffent kind of stay. The rooms are a disgrace. Fithy window nets, dirty carpets and curtains along with shabby bedcoverings and poor room maintenace. The bathrooms are tired but clean, as are the white sheets on the bed. However, the rooms are well overdue a refurbishment. The hotel does however, have a fantastic pool, gym and SPA.  Unfortunately, whilst use of the pool is free there is a charge for the gym and SPA of SG$21  The above said, the hotel is in a great location for the MTR, Raffles Hotel, Chimes, The Opera House, Waterfront and Boat Key. With one of Singapore's best and highest bars on the top floor, the 'New Asia Bar' makes for pleasant drink, if you can cope with the poor service!,…,An average end to a fantastic trip.  My wife and I decided to have a pleasant splurge after a very busy 2004.  So we stayed for a couple of nights in the Shangrila and Four Seasons in Bangkok and a few of nights at the Sofitel in Hua Hin and then at the Anantara at Hua Hin.  Accomodation was full hence the moves.  On the way back to Oz we decided to have a couple of nights and stay at the Swissotel, of which we had read good things.   The closest thing I could describe the experience to is what is called a ""no service"" hotel in Japan.  The difference is that the service is friendly in Japan.  We had: * surly check-in, where the room that had been confirmed was not available, ie we had booked and had confirmation of a double room.  We were ""upgraded"" to a twin.  The check-in, person stated that it was on the executive club level.  But we could not use the executive club.  That is, not an upgrade at all, just the wrong room.  She also said that the room had two queen sized beds.  We thought this would be OK; except the rooms had two single&1/2 size beds.  The check-in person then quoted us the wrong rates, twice - we ended up fishing the booking confirmation out of our luggage in the end.  The person next to us checking in was having a heated arguement about his booking.  Instead of taking the person to the side or to an office the check-in people continued to argue with that person.  In the end we decided to keep the room; we were tired and hungry and wanted to get dinner so that we could go to bed. * the lobby looked like a rugby tour had hit, there were bags and people and stuff all over the place, no sense of calm or order or control.  As you proceeded to the check-in the were ropes as if you were queuing to get an airline ticket.  Surely some more staff would be the answer to this problem not a queuing system. * once we got our key no one directed us to where the rooms were, and we asked another member of staff that person did not know as they only worked at the lobby area. * our room was average - true - a great view., but that is about it.  One of the 1&1/2 beds had been turned down and the pillows positioned in the middle.  We actually first thought that someone must have been using the room.  But then realised that someone probably had moved and that the hotel had not returned the room to its normal state. * the next night someone came in to turn the room down; they had screwed up the bed covers and stuffed them between the bed and the walls.  I have pictures of this. * there were tiles missing in thebathroom between the light bulkhead and the tiled walls. I have pictures of this too. * the cistern of the toilet leaked when the toilet was flushed * the airconditioning went off during the night; my wife and I both woke up in a pool of sweat.   * the room was at 57 floors high.  Quiet you would think.  No! This is at exactly the same level as the AC unit for the other part of the Raffles city plaza.  This is my guess why there was probably a migration to another room by the previous occupant before we had been ""upgraded"". My further guess is that this is kept for other ""upgrades"" * there was a connecting door to the next room, for families and the like.  At 1.00pm for some reason somebody tried to open the door not once but a number of times.  One cannot blame the hotel for this one but it contributed to our sense of unease. * the breakfast was average.  On the second morning we did not even bother but decided to buy it the airport. * the only smile or the like that we got over the whole of our stay was at the end from the doorman as he wished us farewell.  Sums up the stay I suppose. ,…","Family,Harbour View",,,470,89,100
Metropolitan YMCA Singapore,4.0,220 reviews,#49 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean","Share, ,Do not use the on-line reservation system Metropolitan YMCA Singapore has on their web site.  I recently made a reservation on-line using their web site, and within 48 hours of making the reservation, canceled it. They charged my credit card, and when I inquired about the charged, they claimed they never got the cancellation. Even when I forwarded them proof of the cancellation, they refused to take the charge off. I was offered an upgrade on a room on my next stay, which I found a rather asinine offer considering the distance away from Singapore I live.   I can't really comment on the hotel, from what I can tell it seems to be in a good location, but whatever you do, do not use their on-line reservation system. It seems to have problems and they seem unwilling to correct the, problems that do occur. ,…,This was our second stay at the YMCA within 6 weeks. I will only  go into details about major differences from the first review.  I have to mention the first time we stayed at a basic room, now we had a deluxe room as all basic rooms were booked.  Unfortunately it already started no so good when we were greeted with a weird look from the receptionist. After my initial ""Hello, we have a reservation."" he answered with ""Today?"". Still we managed to check in. Now for our 220 SGD including tax room per night, no one showed us the room or bothered to help with the luggage, which they did the first time.  The unconfurtable part started during the second night. First our room neighbours were pretty loud until about midnight. The big problem was that the started shouting again around 7, am in the morning, so I did call the reception to complain. They told me to send someone up to have a look. The result was more shouting and phone ringing for the next 30 minutes. When we went downstairs for breakfast, we saw that it was not other guests but the cleaning stuff who made the noise. At the reception no one looked at us, said something or bothered about an excuse.  As we had a flight later that day we packed up and checked out. Just when leaving the hotel, a women came up to us and introduced herself as the Customer Relations Manager and asked if we would fill out a review form. We agreed and told her that we have to go to the airport and she said it won't take long and she will just go and grap the forms. After 5 minutes waiting for her, we left and went to the airport.  We are not sure what changed in this 6 weeks between the two stays but it felt like two different hotels.,…,My criteria for judging hotels are simple: cleanliness, courtesy, efficiency, availability of hot water showers and baths, clean sheets, brewed coffee for me and fresh fruits for my daughter, and security.  I seriously do not understand why some people would totally diss the place.  My daughter and I had an okay time at the Metro Y in the week we stayed there.  First, the Metro Y's location is perfect.  It's quiet like a typical suburban neighborhood yet just 15 minutes away on foot from Orchard Road (that's timed with a 5-year old in tow).  There is a bus stop in front and free shuttle to Orchard Road in the mornings for those who'd rather ride than walk.  We went to Singapore as tourists so most of the time we were out of the hotel.  As a place to rest however, the room we got, at the Metropolitan YMCA had a clean bathroom with enough supplies (we brought most of our toiletries anyway), the beds were clean and the sheets freshly replaced everytime we returned at night, the swimming pool was clean and not crowded even though there was an entire Australian baseball team with their families staying that time), the laundrette supply was sufficient, the staff efficient and polite, the coffeeshop offered food that satisfies the tired traveller and the buffet breakfast offered enough choices for the oriental and the western palate - croissant, butter, jam, wheat bread, toast, coffee, fruit juice, milk, noodles, cold cuts, eggs, cheese, etc.  Phone worked fine, too.  The desk also took messages accurately when we were out.  I didn't get a chance to use the gym so I can't say anything about it.  I wouldn't live in the hotel or any hotel for that matter as I prefer wide, open spaces ... but the Metropolitan YMCA staff was professional enough to get the bed-and-breakfast job done and nice enough to make a guest feel at home.  Value for money?  Absolutely!  The only thing I didn't like was the television programming, but is that the hotel's fault?  It didn't matter much though, I wasn't awake long enough to get bored anyway.  If you can't live without five-star amenities like a busy lobby, a suite, a gameroom, whatever ... then this is not the place for you.  But if all you need for your stay in Singapore are the basics, then I'd recommend you stay here. ,…,This is a rather belated review as I stayed here Aug '04. The room was basic but large, clean and very cheap which was what I wanted seeing I wouldn't be spending much time there.  The breakfast was horrible, but maybe thats just because I'm not used to eating noodles and chicken sausages (!?) first thing in the morning!  Location was good and was in walking distance of Orchard Road, but a bus stop was located just outside anyway.  Found the staff very friendly and accommodating.  This is the sort of place I would recommend for backpackers, on a budget, stopping over in Singpore enroute to Oz. It is perfectly adequate as a place to simply rest your head for a night or two. Any longer and I'd have booked into Raffles (honest!!!) ,We arrived early, I had begun to feel ill on the plane from Bali, our hometown. The ride from the airport was $25, not very long, and very easy. We were there at 9.30am, but I was becoming even more ill! The very friendly staff checked us in early, without a word. Sadly, I spent the next 24 hours in bed! Then my husband came down with a migraine! But they knew we were ill and didn't bother us at all, even at check out.  This has to be the best (about to be revealed) secret in Singapore. We paid $125 inc taxes.  The room is a good size, very very clean, comfy bed (should know!) with heavy curtains. There is a small fridge to bring in your own stocks (many hotels forbid this). The bathroom is very clean, small, but looks recently re-done.  No-smoking (yay!) and a doona, + blanket.,  There is a huge tennis court, which doubles for basketball, and massive pool.  It is about a 20 min walk from Orchid Rd, or 5 minutes on the bus ($1.10). Watch Saturdays though, very busy. But still acceptable.  Food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. I think water was a bit overpriced ($2) but, had we not been ill, we could have got our own in, so not much for the convenience. Plus, they let you take food from the restaurant up to the room.  Check in staff (2/11) were fantastic. Thank you!  This is a wonderful spot. If you need a room, rather than a palace, I fully recommend this as a very seasoned traveller. Check out if you want to be 20 min walk from town (you will need to get bus or cab to restaurants), but I think it's worth it! Paid the same for a lot less in Melbourne.  Breakfast included. Didn't eat it, but it looked fabulous and by the amount of people just coming in for a meal, must be good. Def. very good value, and freshly cooked.  The only negative is if you are a light sleeper. The traffic can be heard from the rooms. It does back off around 9pm, didn't bother me. Dark curtains were great.  Thumbs up YMCA, will see you again soon!,…",,,,51,11,70

I was feeling very awkward when I could not take in the sun or fresh air for some time.. When Brandon the front office manager , heard my plight, he did one excellent thing for me.. He took it upon himself and changed my room. This enabled me to feel the sun and fresh air and I felt so happy after being cooped up in the other room. I am sure other people would have felt the same but this really lifted my moods and I felt so relieved and relaxed. Staff are nice and courteous but Brandon did the magic and I felt relieved and so happy.

Special thanks to Ms Ann Mapula and her team at Club InterContinental, including Ms Anna of breakfast serving and Mr Fish during evening canapés.

The service rendered by the team made our stay that much more memorable and my family and I really enjoyed the stay at InterContinental Singapore. We look forward to returning to the property. ,Stayed in the hotel during Christmas 2020.  Booked a Deluxe Room that came with breakfast and $50 dining credit which can be utilised for room service.  Room is spacious and clean, there is a speaker in the toilet where you can listen to what the TV is currently playing.  Channels are plently.  Swimming pool is too small and overcrowded, with many kids around.  Room service is great, meal is served promptly and courteous. Breakfast is one set per person due to COVID. Every table came with breads which are already very filling.  Overall, good for a short staycation.,As a IHG Platinum Ambassador member, I had a two night paid staycation at the Intetcontinental Bugis from Thursday to Saturday last week. The Club Intercontinental room with double beds was arranged for us, with access to the exclusive Intercontinental Club Lounge.   Check in at the lobby was quick and friendly, and the IHG membership was recognised. The room was newly renovated, beautiful and amply furnished. Due to the current COVID situation,  housekeeping was no longer a daily affair, though special requests may be made if you need daily housekeeping.  What made this staycation simply memorable was the club lounge experience, with the friendly and kind staff who took great care of us during our stay. The food quality was amazing especially the excellent breakfast quality and, the daily tiered tea sets. We enjoyed this stay very much, and we look forward to our next stay in this property!,…,We booked for a night stay that comes with lounge access which comes with breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canape. The room has a Peranakan feel and is really spacious. The staff has provided us with excellent service. However, we could tell that they were quite shorthanded at the lounge but they still manage to keep up with their services. The evening canape was a lil disappointing as some food were out of stock due to the overwhelming orders. All in all, thanks for feeding us and keeping us satisfied with your hospitality.,Booked in Aug2021 for stay in Dec2021. Paid everything in advance but disappointed that the hotel cancelled our booking now (Oct2021), 2 months after our booking, citing reason that they are full for quarantine. Although refund was offered, we feel cheated. The hotel website is still offering rooms for booking in December 2021 but for a higher rate than the rate we’ve booked.

Jinshan Hotel,3.0,394 reviews,#249 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,We decided that this trip we would stay right in the middle of Chinatown. The online reviews of this hotel were mixed but we are big fans of simpler 3 star hotels. We booked online and were surprised at how good our choice was! The staff were great, the room was clean and comforatble. The location was superb. And it wasn't as noisy as we thought it might be. We were delighted.,I would rather call it a hostel, very small and stuffy, no AC in the so called ‘lobby’ , though pretty good internet, one of the pluses of the hotel, the other plus is the price, with the rest is a ‘no’ , though close to metro, for one night stay maybe a ‘yes’, if would be given again to choose, most probably would choose something else, as the pictures are not quite the same as presented, unfortunately ,Checked in for a few days before a cruise. Have a friend who works in Singapore and stays here. It is a basic hotel on the third floor of a office building, has lift no stairs to climb. Rooms are small but clean, AC works good and good internet. Great location in Chinatown close to the MRT, for the price could not beat it. I was paying SG$60.00 per night for two people in Deluxe Room.   The bad news I believe the hotel lost its lease will be closing in November of 2018. But for now great deals.,This is a good hotel at central of Chinatown. The room is small.  Strictly no smoking as there will be fine customers service is bad too. Very rigid n not flexible. Overall still ok if u are just looking for a place for stay only. ,its in a old building. room smells really bad. a room can't be smaller than this.  requested for a early checkin of 2 hours. room was available but asked for a half day charge.  it was very uncomfortable stay.

The Amazing Inn,3.0,6 reviews,#29 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,By coincidence my Singapore trip took place exactly during the Formula 1 weekend. Difficult to find a suitable place and finally ended up here, at the Amazing Inn. Renovation seems in progress already for a long time, so the entrance was a bit messy. Super friendly staff, very helpful. Tiny room but with comfy bed, coffee and tea making facilities, small but clean bathroom with plenty of hot water. Once a checked out, nobody was able to hand me the bill. I asked the lady to send it by email. Even before I arrived at the airport they sent me a copy already. Surroundings at night a bit scary. Illegal cigarette dealers in front of the door and plenty of massage parlors and 'love stores'.  In short: I enjoyed my stay here in this cozy place. Will be back for sure.,Stayed here for one night on a layover to Australia.  The hotel is not too far from a train station. The room is small. Bed is comfortable and the hotel provides free wifi and bottled water. The TV in the room did not work properly and there was no way to lock the door from the inside - just a latch you closed.,4 stars because for what it costs, you can't expect much better. I paid $100 to stay overnight and have late checkout at 5pm the next day. The room was very tired and rundown but was clean, it had aircon and fridge, it was quiet, just of Geylang Road.

Zen Rooms Bukit Merah,3.0,4 reviews,#287 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,free wifi,Orchard Road,Chinatown,free wifi,Free Wifi,ZenRooms Bukit Merah offers accommodation in Singapore. Airport transfers are available at a surcharge.  Every room at this hotel is air conditioned and has a TV. Rooms are equipped with a private bathroom equipped with a shower. ZenRooms Bukit Merah features free WiFi throughout the property.  VivoCity is 1.2 km from ZenRooms Bukit Merah, while Adventure Cove Waterpark is 1.8 km away. The nearest airport is Changi Airport, 19 km from the property.  The room is just fine for 1 or 2 person. I think it is more like motel, but they want to call it as hotel is just fine for me. You can think of a room in a private apartment. If you need to do laundry, you might need to go laundry kiosk nearby since laundry machine provided by the hotel doesn't seems to be hygienic. Plenty of, amenities nearby, shops is walking distance, bus stop, etc but bare in mind, this hotel have no room service. Thus if you crave for food, just try grabfood or foodpanda, mostly will take just 20-30 mins.,…,Paid over $180 AUD for this room through Agoda under the understanding breakfast was included- certainly thought it was included at this price - only to be told in morning (after they said at night it was) it wasn't included- disgrace. Apart from misleadingly not providing breakfast rooms are very noisy ( thumping techno could be heard in bed from across street til midnight) you also have to slug your bags up and down concrete steps, which I slipped !!!! STAY ANYWHERE ELSE!!!,I haven't been there yet. I booked this for three nights on agoda.com. it said I had the option to pay at the hotel. I received confirmation and I thought everything was going great. Two days before my reservation I went on line to check my email and saw that agoda.com had tried to charge my credit card but because of my cards fraud security, and I was not supposed to be in Singapore for four days, the charge was declined. Then I received another email on the following day, saying that they had cancelled the reservation. All this time I am thinking I have the option to pay at the hotel. Anyway, I went online and chatted with the hotel, and was rebooking when I was told I have to pay up front.  I have stayed at several hotels where they require your credit card to hold the, reservation, but I received notification from my credit card company that Zen had charged my credit card for the three days and I am not even going to check in for two more days. I will ask them about this when I get to the hotel.  I also tried to review agoda.com, but am unable to an trip advisor.,…,S-P-A-C-Y , airy, fresh, new, light room with windows that can open and all  facilities you want, but local calling and a safe locket.   Best features; the plug in the sink,  and individually controllable airco, !!  Excellent sleep quality. . Good staff.  Nothing left to wish for.   Great location close to Vivo city and Sentosa, Got used to traffic noise rather fast, also to lack of shops and eateries in close vicinity of hotel.   The smell  some people complain about in reviews seems to be Lysol, I do not dislike it so much One disadvantage, when extending you pay way too high Harbourville hotel rate for the same room which is  double the Zen fee  Zen rooms  seems to be a company that buys rooms in existing hotels and rents them out at more reasonable rates.

The Elizabeth Hotel,4.0,"2,112 reviews",#144 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,Was placed at this hotel for quarantine when I came back early this year. Proper covid safety measures was observed, which I appreciated. We had to wait longer before being able to go to our rooms but understandable given the circumstances.   Room was spacey and convenient for work. Had big windows where I could at least see the outside world.   What I loved most was the daily check ins by duty manager. She'd call to ask about my wellbeing, feedback on service and if there was anything else they could do to make my stay more comfortable. That personalised human touch made a big difference. Definitely stood out from all the quarantine hotels I stayed at.,Pictures are deceiving for sure. I was supposed to be booked into a non-smoking room. Ended up being placed on a smoking floor and the entire floor was smelling. Apart from the outdated rooms, there were cockroaches and bugs littered in the bathroom. Asked for an upgrade to a better room, unfortunately nothing else was available at the time due to a conference being on at the time, which left with no choice but to check out after a nights stay and book another hotel. On a plus note, the staff there are very nice!,it's a quiet old hotel. nearby to Orchard. the room is spacious. however, the power points are not located by the bedside. the TV is not a smart TV. the furniture needs an upgrade as the sofa chairs are just too soft. ,Spent 8 nights in the Elizebeth hotel. Room was clean and well serviced, staff at reception very helpful. Met the manager who was very interested in our experience and feedback. It was a very nice touch. Special mention of Abdul on the tourist ""desk"", such a great help, advised us on where to go and where to avoid ( in regards to value for money etc). If you talk to him he gives honest and great advice. Hotel is brilliantly located to transport and shopping precint.,Check in was a little difficult, but made up for by the amazing concierge who is very friendly and helpful.

Hotel Clover 7,3.5,96 reviews,#9 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Room 215 is Super clean has a great shower but Is mega small. Don't come here with your hold luggage, it would be a bit of a nightmare. Cabin bags and two adults and your at capacity. No reception staff on arrival, they are situated in Clover 5 next door so start there first. There is no bar. The room actually, has everything you need, a great, powerful walk in waterfall shower, uk plugs, free safe, fridge, kettle hairdryer and a mass of towels and shower gels. Smart TV with a few English channels. Bed was excellent, soooo comfortable. Breakfast is an additional $12 SGD but we skipped it, however we popped into the small restaurant in Clover 5 and it looked an ok spread. At the time of writing we paid for one night, $120 SGD (£68) so pricey for what it is but hey that's, Singapore. Very close to the Quay and good 45 mins stroll to the Gardens (plan your route first!!).  Check out again was done in Clover 5 although they process the payment back in Clover 7 which is a bit of a faff.   I've rated Clover a four star because of the size of the room V the cost but it was perfect for what we needed for a cheeky overnight connection. Close to the City Hall MRT and below I've added some MRT tips if you decide to stay here:   Tips on using the MRT. Prior to leaving the U.K. Download the MRT map and print it off or save the PDF to your smart phone. When you arrive at Changi Airport terminal 1 make sure your you obtain Local currency in lower denominations (5 or 2 dollar notes), this is important for the MRT. You cannot (are the time of writing use your debit or credit card & to obtain tickets) Ticket machines will also only accept coins and $5 (SGD) or $2 notes. From terminal 1 head to the sky train and get off at terminal 3, grab the elevator down to to floor B2 and go straight ahead and down the escalators.  Go to the ticket machines which are behind the escalators to the left hand side as you come down and buy a single which will cost (as @ 22/08/17) $2.80 or around £1.65. The tubes / trains are frequent and easy to use and initially will leave from both sides.  You will need to change at Tanah Merah (it terminates here in any case). Keep your card ticket as you can top it up at a discount of around 10% each time you use it.   Have a great time!,…,Hotel Clover 7 is a recent addition to this hospitality brand, which includes The Arts and Hotel Clover 5. All 3 hotels are real close to each other.   The Hotel is a few minutes walk from Clarke Quay metro station (and the malls around it) but in a relatively quiet part of this bustling area.  For people unaccustomed to Singapore's hotels, they would probably complain about the size of the room. If you have big luggage and need space to hang your whole wardrobe, this hotel would not be for you. However, if you are fine with living out of your suitcase (there is no cabinet to speak of in the room I was in), need a comfortable bed to sleep in, you'd find Hotel Clover just right.   I personally like the details of the room, from the plush bed and pillows, the space under it to, stow my bags, the wash area in the hallway (which reduces the space required for the bath). The lights are operated by a remote on the ""study"" table while another set of buttons operate the blinds. I really appreciated the full set of toiletries that were provided (toothbrush, shower cap, soaps, cotton buds, slippers, shampoo and shower gel) and the drinks that were stocked in the mini fridge.   Because of the limited space in the building, breakfast was served a few doors away at hotel Clover 5, which also houses the rooftop pool and gym. Again, nice touches that were plus points for this property.   As far as service was concerned,I really appreciated how the hotel responded to my requests for an emergency change in my booking. The male staff who checked me in last July 10 was very friendly and had EVERYTHING ready... and even when I asked to change rooms as they assigned me to a connecting room, it was done in less than 5 minutes. However, the succeeding front office staff were not as friendly as he was, but I guess still efficient.   One thing I have to note, however, is that they do require a block of SG$50 on a credit card. This was not made clear to me when they asked for a verification. In other hotels, I simply offered to give a deposit rather than have an amount blocked on my card. but this is a small issue.,…,So, here is the thing: room in Singapore is scarce and this hotel was one of the only ones offering a private room with ensuite bathroom within our budget. Let me say though, that if you are claustrophobic, this hotel is not for you.  But, first off, if you know what you are getting into, this hotel is just fine. The location is great, there are many restaurants and tourist attractions within walking distance. Staff was quite friendly and helpful too. However, we didn't like to spend more time than necessary in this tiny room.  The bed is really quite small and for a tall couple like us (me, 172cm and my partner 193cm) it was not really comfy to say the least. Also, in our room, the aircon blew right into our faces when lying in bed, no matter what mode (we ended up waking up, with a sore throat...). What was more is that the little light on the fire alarm lit up the entire room so brightly at night, we had to put a bandaid on it to dim it a little :D But there is to say, that our room was considerably clean and quiet as well.  There was a window in the room, which is not self-evident in Singapore hotels, but the automatic blinds could either be shut down completely or not at all. There was no in between, either daylight or darkness.  In conclusion, I would not book this hotel again. We were quite glad to move to another, more spacious hotel room after four days at Clover 7. However, as said, if you are prepared to spend the nights in a tiny room (at a budget), this hotel is just fine.,…,This have to be the smallest rooms ever. I only give two stars for the location, the comfy bed and the room service. I was satisfied with that.  The elevator makes beeping noises out of hell. All the time. It beeps at least 6 times when someone is using it. Also the so called 'walls' are paperthin. I had small ant-like insects inside my room. Most of the time there is no one at the reception.  Through my 'window' you could see the lobby. Yeah... No view outside.  Go to another place. I would not recommend staying here. ,This was my third stay at Clover 7 that opened in June 2016. Love the design of the rooms, the cleanliness, the comfy bed and the great pillows. Breakfast is delicious, wifi good and staff friendly. A plus is the access to the rooftop pool at adjacent Clover 5.Great location close to everything. Will stay there again.",Centrally Located,7695,ZenHotels.com,701,109,100

Breakfast was included, but very simple and not enough space for everyone to sit. Good location, a short walk to the metro station. Washing machines provided but quite expensive.,I stayed 2 nights with my wife, hostel is following very detailed rules which gives trust, safty, cleanliness experience to traveller. breakfast was also good not a huge range  but you will get enough to fill your tummy. Bathroom, washrooms, and living rooms are clean and well maintained  no complain about it,  washing machine also there but chargeble.  best is hostel location you will get very good only veg restaurant named GOPAL  and  mix veg non veg  just few meter away from Gopal.  near by MRT is ferrar park and  just opposite of hostel you will get bus option which will take you to vivo city  for santosa.,Staff are friendly and helpful. Cool co-travelers. Nice location to stay. More closer to Rochor station MRT. But there is no lift. Nice breakfast. We had been allotted to use shared bathroom. But there is no lift.,Terrible stay with hostel. They cheat with the customers. Booked for three night but say go out from hostel after two nights without any refund and spent whole night on the road. No so much choice for breakfast and nothing for Indians. Never plan for stay with this hostel.,We booked for 2 nights in this hostel and already paid. After a delay we arrived to this hostel from The airport at 2h05 am. We didnt know the reception closes at 2 am. It's 6h30 am and we are still waiting in the street in front of the hostel. We tried everything but impossible to contact the owner, no inscription for us on the door, no mail with a password to enter, no call to care about their guests. Apparently those People just went to sleep even if their guests were on the road to their hostel and let them sleep in the street.

Darlene Hotel,2.5,24 reviews,#318 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,You know you're in a dubious hotel when you arrive and the entrance is surrounded by prostitutes and the rates are displayed by the hour... there was a constant check in of couples looking for an hour away and prostitutes with their clients, why else would you rent by the hour? Saying that it was much quieter in the morning, it's not really peak time for that.  The room was sort of clean, small and very aged. You get free wifi and you are steps away from Geyland Road where you will find lots of cheap and cheerful restaurants where we had great Chinese food. It's a couple of stops away by MRT from the centre but it's 10 minutes walk from the station but then it's quite cheap for Singapore prices (which are generally expensive).  Was amusing to arrive to the room hearing the, screams from the lady next door having sex and trying to impress her customer... you don't get that too often elsewhere. So extra points for entertainment value.  The bed covers never seemed to be used so they were stored in a cupboard but then again, if you rent the room for an hour you probably wouldn't use them, right? The air conditioned is controlled centrally so we had to disconnect the room's lights as it was kind of cold with the air conditioning at full blast - you see, we weren't getting as much exercise as the he neighbours.   You sleep in the bed wondering if you'll wake up with insect bites but then on the up side the pillows are covered in a plastic leather with the linen on top so I guess that makes them fairly resistant to insects if not a bit stiff to the touch. We didn't get any bites.  We stayed one night and on the way back we decided we couldn't stay again in the same place... for obvious reasons.,…,I aim for this to be a fair review so will start with a positive: the staff are very helpful and after booking a three night stay, refunded us happily after deciding to only stay one night.  Now on to the negatives... This hotel is effectively a place for prostitutes to operate from.  We didn't realise when we checked in during the day, but the rooms have the option for an hourly rate (for the aforementioned reason) and the pillows had thick plastic liners on them (I don't even want to think of why...). The room was not at all clean, with cigarette burns on the sheets and a couple of blood stains too.  The bathroom was old and dirty - far from ideal.    I understand a budget hotel is not going to have the most modern facilities but cleanliness is very important and shouldn't be, too much to ask.  We luckily had sleeping bag liners with us which we slept in and used our bags for pillows.  Due to the nature of the hotel, it would be impossible for the rooms to be cleaned in between 'clients'...    I would definitely not recommend this hotel for anyone with children or, for that matter, anyone who would not be interested in the additional services of the hotel.,…,Ive stayed in Darlene Hotel but this time was a so freaking bad,coz i left my luggage and some of groceries worth 700 Singapore dollars but when my friend get my stuff all my groceries was missing and it cost 700 Singapore dollars.and i tried to contact the staff Ali and he said he will be the one to send my things to me,but my friend who is in Singapore will be the one to give him money and also the payment for him to be send to me.but when me and my friend trying to contact him last Sunday he blocked me on his whatsapp and even he don't answer our text and phone call.when my friend went this afternoon October 22,2014,many things was missing on my stuff most especially the groceries which is worth 700 Singapore dollars and almost luggage was opened knowing that there is a, locked number on my luggage.this staff and this hotel cannot be trusted and you should not ,eft your things coz they will get your things and if anyone have same experienced with me please let give this staff a lesson...i earned my groceries and supposed to be send to my family but they had interest to get all my things and some of my stuff are missing so don't ever try to stay in this hotel coz this hotel is not safe when it comes to most valuable things and important things.,…,We found the hotel last minutes, just for attending  events at Expo and Suntec. Do not expect much fancy room. This is cheap, old, but quite clean. None shouting, none is drunk, none is banging the door, so we quite satisfied.. quiet enough so we can sleep for travellers. If you bring kids, you might want to other options because this is located at red light district... Honestly, this is the cheapest rate for twin bed room with shower, but we prefer to stay here rather than at bunk hostel. If bring elderly, better use taxi lah..,Location : you have to walk about 10-20 mins from nearest MRT Station. There's lot of food courts and shops around. Not recommended for staying with parents or family since there's lot of prostitute at some nights around Geylang. I used Uber Taxi to reach airport and it was so cheap from here!  Price : Good!  Place/Room : Great! Wide enough for 2 people completed by good Wi-Fi, shower room and elevator to be reached.  Staff : Helpful!",,,,59,5,75
Le Grove Serviced Apartments,4.0,286 reviews,#46 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,Ecxellent Apartments situated within walking distance of Orchard Road and the Tanglin Shopping area. Each apartment comes with 1 or 2 bedrooms and has a spacious living area, a fully furnished kitchen and  dining area. Our apartment was fully equiped with a wash/dryer, storage space, TV with VCD and DVD.  The kitchen contained a multi-functional microwavve, oven, hob and fridge. The apartment block on Orange Grove Road also has an outside swimming pool, suana facilities and tennis courts. Very useful is the free shuttle service to MRT stations, shopping areas and supermarkets. Staff are friendly and accommodating, making our stay very pleasant. An oasis of calm in a busy city. Highly recommended. ,We booked this apartment and paid almost £200 a night for a two bedroom apartment thinking it,s nearby Orchard Road, yes it is as stated on the website, however Km shown on the website are to the end of orchard road.  Rooms were not as big as we expected and breakfast? It's probably the worst breakfast I ever had in a hotel or apartment. It includes some water melon, pine apple, oranges, orange juice ( not fresh ) cereals , only one type of bread, butter, tea and coffee. Do NOT ASK FOR FRIED EGG OR OMELATE because they do not provide that.  We were 4 in total ( Two disabled on wheel chair ) we took one wheel chair with us thinking hotel might have a wheel chair. Hotel did have only one wheel chair and told us, when ever we need, we will get it back from our room, so kindly don't, take it outside. In the end we hired one from the local shop.  Coming back to the breakfast, because we had two disable ladies and one career, I was the only one who could have breakfast in the restaurant so I requested if I could have disabled and career breakfast in the room. Answer was, No  I asked if I could take breakfast in the room myself, Elsie said, yes so I asked for a tray, answer was, No We don't have any tray although I could see all trays in kitchen myself.  There were very small serving plates so I just took some fruit ( Mainly water Mellon ) in two plates and asked my carer to take some savouries in two plates, no bread, cereals, tea or cofee.  Following day when when I came downstairs to have breakfast, I was stoped by Elsie and she told me, I took too much yesterday therefore am not allowed to take that much.  That was really embarrassing for me some one accusing me over food. It wasn't too much, water Mellon takes lot of space on a very small plate and I could fit only 5 pcs of water Mellon in a plate, that was disgusting of her saying some thing like that and I felt really embarrassed. What the hell was she thinking, we were greedy over food?   If we could afford nearly £800 to book a apartment, we could afford having decent breakfast some where else rather than a labeled breakfast le grove provide.  We were there for 4 days, we didn't bother having breakfast for remaining two days. If that is sort of service Le Grove provide, I would rather stay away next time.,…,this was perfect for our family of four.  (kids ages 9 and 14) We have 5 nights in Singapore and the apartments were large so plenty of space to relax. Two large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a big lounge and kitchen. All in good condition and clean. Our apartment was higher up and had a good view - I asked for both of these requirements. The pool was great. We didn't have the breakfast as we are all Gluten free and our time zone was so out we were not awake in time most days! The walk down to Orchard road is easy but equally you could order a taxi or use the hotel shuttle. After a big days walking around Singapore the walk home was a bit hard/hot some days but perfectly manageable. I recommend getting the Singapore Tourist pass so you can use the MRT and buses freely. Staff on the, front desk were very helpful and accommodating.,…,This was my first stay at Le Grove but my parents who frequently travel to Singapore have stayed here repeatedly. Normally in a two bedroom, but there were 6 of us this time so we rented the 3-bedroom-3 bath.   The goods: - Two bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms attached while the third bedroom has a smaller bathroom outside. Considering the importance of space is in Singapore, the place feels very spacious and homey. It actually reminds me of a nice three bedroom condo in a nice suburb in the US. The bedrooms by no means gigantic, but they are nicely decorated and the good use of space doesn't make you feel cramped. All of us had 2 giant rolling suitcases and we were able to fit them all in perspective bedrooms with no problems.   - Fast internet. I will get back to the issue of, the internet later, but for now, let's focus on the speed. We had no interrupted service during our stay. Wifi worked great even with 5 iPads-laptops being used at the same time, which included a movie streaming. - good sized kitchen for those days you are sick of eating out (which seriously never happened when I am on vacation)   - nice amenities such as pool, gym facility. We took advantage of both and were pleased at the cleanliness of both. The gym is tiny with two treadmills, one elliptical and one bike machine for the lure of me I couldn't figure out how to use the 4 days I was there. Weights are also available. My only complaint about the gym would be the stuffiness of it. It is located in a basement type of room so there are no windows and when not being used, the air conditioner isn't on, so it gets really stuffy in there. Other than that, it is workable.   - free shuttle bus to town. I'll get to the location a bit later, but having this feature is a nice added value as taking a taxi to Orchard Rd does add up after awhile.   Can be improved: - washer-dryer combo included which was a plus. However, I personally had never heard of a washing machine that's also a dryer so it took us a few tries to get it work. It would have been nice to include a direction on how to use. Not to mention, the trouble of locating a market that actually sold laundry detergent (no seriously!), so it would be nice to have such included.   - location - I personally have a mixed feeling about the location. I think it's nice that it's not on the busy part of the town (and you know how crazy busy Singapore can get), but it is also a pain to get back to after a long day of sightseeing or shopping (boy, Singapore sure has a lot of shopping!). You can try to walk but honestly,it's quite a hike up from Orchard Rd. My sixty year old parents had no problem doing so daily though which embarrassed me to no end as I preferred taxi.   - free continental breakfast daily except weekend or national holiday is a nice feature to have but honestly, I was ""meh"" about it. Everything that should be cold aka milk would be sitting out lukewarm for I don't know how long. I don't believe milk should be out in room temperature for that long. I ended up avoiding things like cereal for fear of getting sick, which left me with not a lot of choices. The spread included curry buns that were always the first to go and never got refilled, dinner rolls, donuts, fruits, yogurt (another thing sitting out in a luke warm temperature) and selections of cereals. I did however appreciate the espresso machine. We are a group of non-functioning people pre-coffee.  Need improvements: - since we are on the coffee subject, why isn't there drinkable coffee in the apartment itself? We got two tiny instant package coffee daily which were not drinkable with one sugar package and sometimes not refilled. For six dwellers, two instant coffee and one sugar package to share is unacceptable! Perhaps the downstairs espresso machine was to make up for it? But you don't have access to that on a weekend so you are stuck with the disgusting coffee.   - I've mentioned the fast wifi above. It still boggles my mind how some hotels still require their guests to pay for wifi. My parents paid for it so I don't know how much additional per day they are charging for it. But seriously, if shopping malls give you free wifi, shouldn't a place you are actually paying to stay at include that feature too?  -Why so stingy on the shampoo and body soap bottles? They really take the saving resources to the next level as we ran out of shampoo and soap and they weren't refilled.   - staff is a hit or miss. Actually, we encountered more miss than hit, which was unfortunate.   Overall, it was a pleasant stay. A good place for a group, especially. For the amount of $$ spent for a group our size, we would be spending a lot more for sure. I am giving it a 4 out if 5 which is quite high for me as the annoyances are nothing but little annoyances that may just be because of my OCD-ness (with exception of the staff's friendliness, which I think is a must in the hospitality industry!).,…,We booked a two-bedroom apartment via online.We stayed for 4 nights. The room was spacious and very clean. My comments will be as similar to other guests who has posted their comments about this apartment. It was a luxurious apartment, situated along a highly exclusive area. The room is fully equipped with a washer-dryer, and it help us a lot, as we bring only a handful of clothes during our stay in Singapore. There is a free shuttle bus to Universal Studio at nearby Shangri-La Hotel. Just produce your room keys/card as proof, and you will be allowed to alight.  The receptionist was very friendly upon our arrival. The check-in time was very efficient without much problems. High speed internet is chargeable at USD3 per night, but worth it. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here at, this apartment and will stay here again in the future. Bravo for a great service...,…","Residential Neighbourhood,Mid-range",,,19,3,84
5footway.inn Project Chinatown 1,4.0,891 reviews,#62 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,Poor hospitality & hostel management, didn't show consideration/put customers' need as priority.   Booked under non refundable rate and stated that payment will be charged if no show, however, they charged 2 months prior to check in date.   Unwilling to accommodate to traveller's need due to COVID 19 outbreak by modifying date of stay.,We stayed in 5FOOTWAY for 3 nights. This is not my first time stay in 5FOOTWAY. No doubt, the location is good and it’s cheap. Therefore I have no expectations at all. Unfortunately we have an terrible experience this time.   First, self checkin service not so convenience. There is a self-check in service when you get into the hostel. We have a little problem and cannot get the room access card. Therefore we have to call the staff through the phone which they provide on top of the checkin machine but we found out the phone is not working. Anyways, we fixed it by ourself.  Secondly, soundproof was pretty bad! We stayed in a room next to the main guestroom door gate, Terrace and bathroom. We can hear that everyone accessed the guest room corridor very clearly every single time. Of, course we can also hear other guests were talking at terrace. The cleaning staffs started to wash bathroom or washing the floor in the morning at 7am, we even can hear the whole process of cleaning and smell the detergent.   Third, staffs are not helpful. After first night experience, we requested to change our room. As we don’t have phone card, we decided to send a message through Agoda booking record but no one reply until check out. Besides, no earplugs has provided.  Forth, the 3rd night before check out. There was an fire accident downstair shop in midnight 2:30am. Strong smoke has spread to whole hostel. Luckily no one hurts and we wore our pajama walk down to the street. One staff from other branch finally appeared but she keeps saying have to wait for the manager’s reply. Firemen were gone around 4:30am, that staff said we can go back to our room but without any special arrangement, no refund. How can we accept to sleep in a strong smell room?   Last, twin room without side table and locker, which is not match with online photo. Bunk bed is too high and hard to climb up, it’s dangerous when you walk down from upper bed.,…,For you looking for Chinatown is the place, very close with MRT. Room was nice, have lockers is side by key card. You no need worry about safety. Hostel have breakfast also, but noisy from outsiders. For Backpacker is choice. ,Location: 5/5 as this property located right at the Chinatown MRT (exit A). Plenty to see and eat. Do not miss the food court in Chinatown! This is the hidden treasure where all the locals go for good local food at affordable price.  Room 16.5 & 16.6: This is a small room with 3 bunk beds. We took 1 bunk bed. Use your room card to place your belonging in the small locker under the bed. Thin walls, basically if you can't endure the noise from the room nx to you, this is not the place for you. Bugs spotted crawling on the wall, felt disgusted and wished nothing will happen to me as I only stay for a night.  Share bathroom: Shower gel provided inside. Remember to bring your own towel or else prepare to pay SGD5 to rent for 1 (this is what you pay for!).   Service: Self check-in, kiosk machine. Prepare to scan your passport at the smart machine. DIY kinda thing, no front desk or staff to welcome (this is what you pay for!). Nevertheless, the cleaner lady was super helpful and friendly.   Breakfast: Make your own toast with coffee and cereal drink at the terrace.   Overall: Will only recommed this if you are on a super tight budget and looking for place near the train station or Chinatown.,…,Their website advertises with spacious pictures a fancy looking and ""boutique"" style Hostel. It doesn't exist.  This place is rundown, cramped, depressing, outrageously overpriced. The bunk beds feel like cages to me who is 1,87cm. Every bed I stayed at in Indonesia budget travelling was larger and more comfortable. Be aware, theres not even a reception. Upon arrival you get to communicate with a robot who leaves you frustrated after plane travel coz it's all not clear yet and steals your time and energy.  This is what I call scam.","Centrally Located,Budget",,,706,116,100
OSS Backpackers Hostel @ Lavender,3.5,12 reviews,#153 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,  · It’s about S$42/person. We got the family room for 6people. But the soundproofing is not very good so in the morning, when people have breakfast, it is very noisy for who stays in G floor like us. English speaking, helpful and nice staff.  · Only 2 restroom and bathroom at G floor :( Everything looks clean but the pillow caused me a really bad itch. I had to wake up at midnight to scratch because it’s really bad and I can not sleep. I had to put the towel on top the pillow so it didn’t touch my skin anymore. So I can sleep from that.,Stayed here 2 nights for a company trip. Was an okey place to stay. Stayed at the female dorm, the room is tiny, double bed bunk style with curtain for privacy, reading light and power socket. There are also lockers in the room. The bathroom is a shared bathroom - very clean and they provided shower gel in each shower roam.  Free breakfast also provided but only bread with plenty of jams and peanut butter and also cereals.  Free wifi - good and fast and if you want to use computers, there are 3 computers (if im not mistaken) downstairs.  The front desk staff is friendly and very helpful.  Overall i would say this place is okey for a short stay.,If there is a word thats lower than terrible that is the word thats best describes this hostel. Starting at the reception with the guy who looks like a robot or machine just doing his job, to the bad smell room. We tried our best to endure the smell yet we can't so we just slept outside at the living area looking for other hostel to stay. We checked out and said we dont like the room, didnt even ask for a refund but the guy at the reception didnt even bother to ask why or apologize. Well its our fault cause we chose to stay in a cheap place. We didnt expect that the price is cheap as the hostel as well. Better to sleep at the streets.   Good thing my friend's aunt let us stay in their house.,Stayed here at the end of March, only getting a chance to review now. This is a great accommodation option in Singapore as hostels/hotels can be very expensive. This hostel was reasonably priced. The room is tiny and it consisted of four double beds in a bunk bed style, kind of like pods. The bed was comfortable with a curtain for privacy, reading light and power socket. There are also lockers in the room for your valuables. Very nice breakfast included, always a plus for the budget backpacker. The only negative comment we have is that there was no lock on our bedroom door so probably not the most secure but all of our valuables were in the locker anyway. There were also only two bathrooms, probably not enough for the amount of people staying in the hostel.,We stayed in the couples room, on a double-bunk-bed. It was comfortable, we had a curtain for privacy, and power outlets by our heads. There was an in-room locker (key included) and there were only three other beds in the room which was nice.  What wasn't so great, was the breakfast and common area (tiny) right outside the room which meant it was noisy in the evening and the morning.  Breakfast was toast with a plethora of jams an peanut butters, and a cocoa-puff type cereal that kinda looked like dog food. There was plenty and it got re-stocked regularly.  The bathrooms were clean, and the showers had shampoo and soap in them.  The front desk staff was friendly and accommodating.  If you're a guy staying in the male dorm, you'll be bunking in with a bunch of east-Indian, workers, and you'll be on a separate floor from the breakfast room.   Tips: get the couples room, bring your own towel, and don't sit at a table watching Netflix while everyone's trying to find a place to sit down and eat their breakfast.,…",,,,254,23,94

We have been couple of staycation over past two years, but still prefer treetop.  Our stay is restful, daily house keeping well done and near to great shopping with nature at nearby botanic garden.  We will definitely come back again, it become our retreat in Singapore.,We had a very pleasant 2 weeks at Treetops during the Covid period. The staff were very helpful and friendly and we were surprised by how quiet the apartments were even though many apartments were occupied. The lush greenery complimented the ambience and gave the feel of a small complex. Also the Treetops shuttle bus was extremely handy . In the breakfast cafe the staff worked hard every morning to make us feel safe and provide a varied breakfast in spite of covid limitations. We will certainly return upon our next visit to Singapore as soon as the VTL system allows us. To all staff : we wish you a very healthy 2022.,My husband and I chose to celebrate our anniversary at Treetops last week. We are back again for a longer stay and am very grateful for the wholesome services provided here. Each time we come here, we will be greeted warmly by every staff we see.   The cleaning staff also did a very fantastic job in ensuring that our apartment are all dust free and they maintained it just like the first day we check in.   There are also some plans made for their green environment. We can opt out of changing bed linens wherever possible, a good initiative.   Would definitely recommend for those seeking for such comfortable and high quality stay in a clean environment.,While on pictures Treetops looks very nice, the reality is they have cockroaches in the services apartments.  I found cockroaches in the kitchen, despite housekeeping cleaning the apartment every day. This shows Treetops have a cockroaches problem and should be avoided at all cost.,Stayed here for a couple of weeks and I must say everything here is marvellous. The people here really valued their guests and make them feel comfortable like at home. My favourite spot would be the swimming pool, great for some relaxation on weekends. When I’m doing my work in the room, the greenery view outside helps. Kudos to the team for making my stay here memorable!","Family,Great View",,,127,28,100

I would definitely come back again or any of the pan pacific groups. They have definitely make my stay memorable and I truly enjoy it.,We just held our wedding banquet at Si Chuan Duo Hua restaurant at Park Royal on bench road. Their service and food is generally good! The wedding decorations is up to standard. Especially like the fried cod fish dish and dessert  =),Nice and clean hotel, though feels abit dated. Room is spacious. You can find the usual amenities of a hair dryer minibar, fridge. Some items I consider a bonus includes iron and board, and digital safe.   The room we have overlooks the front of the hotel and the road, an interesting change of looking at the hustle and bustle of the city.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful.   Location wise it’s quite off the beaten track, but it has a lot to offer for those who like to explore the shophouse, restaurant and cafe right opposite. Otherwise Bugis Junction is within walking distance. There is limited car parking space right in front of the hotel.  I like the food at restaurant Ginger.,I just held my wedding banquet at the PARKROYAL Beach Road Sky Ballroom.  The food was delicious and the service was considerate and great.  Special mention to Felicia, the hotel representative and Eric the Banquet Manager that managed my banquet.  Eric was very responsive and took initiative to make sure my wedding lunch went smoothly. He also gave very useful guidance and tips to us (the bride and groom) and also our parents, for example what to do during the march in and solemnization.   Would recommend couples to host their wedding there.","Family,Green",,,394,71,99

Overall good hotel to stay and very helpful. Should visit again to this hotel, most convenient place to stay.,Situated just a stone throw away from clark quay and the Marina, the best thing about the hotel is its location. The view from the top of the hotel is just amazing and a thing to look out for. The room was spacious and neatly made but could need some refinement. Would definitely recommend for the location.,Saw the review title from the previous review from other guest and just copy paste and add poor customer service. Normally I do not give bad review unless its really bad. Well, it was not me to choose this hotel willingly but was force to stay here. Anyway just wanted to say that the customer service, helpdesk,even the manager on  call is not up to expectation. Helpdesk did not check before answering my question, manager on call did not direct my concern and issue correctly but raise her voice to me and force me to made the laundry payment unwillingly.

Dorsett Singapore,4.0,"1,367 reviews",#109 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,My experience with Dorsett Singapore was overall a pleasant one. Upon arrival, I was subjected to a series of health declarations, much more extensive than any other hotels I have visited so far. The reception staff was polite and courtly, and empahsised that due to the size of my room, I could only have a maximum of 2 guests, even though the general guidelines in Singapore say that it's a maximum of 5. That did disrupt the plans a little but I made do.  The room had a few minor issues when I first arrived. 3 of the light sources in the room was not working properly, and unfortunately some of the additional things I have requested for was not fulfilled. But they made it up by sending a gorgeous came from the famous Keong Saik Bakery, along with a drawing on the glass surfaces, near the door to help celebrate the occasion. These touches made a difference to my overall experience.  The room's amenities was comfortable and adequate. The king sized bed was more than sufficient for the two of us and we had a blissful night's rest. Overall, I would recommend Dorsett Singapore for individuals or couple who are interested to explore Chinatown in Singapore.,…,Love this hotel location, I decided to move from a five star hotel to Dorsett. I had been stranded in SG since MCO and CB between JB/SG. Food, transportation to work and accommodation are my primary consideration. Thanks to the sales team (Dennis) to secure long term stay in Dorsett with a special rate. The room is clean and comfort with great service by their housekeeping team. The only suggestion to improve the APP for safe entry and input the daily repetition questions though you are registered guest.,This is a cheap and cheerful hotel, that's in a great area of Singapore.  It has an amazing bath in the Splash Room, which was a highlight. the swimming area is on teh basic side, but it is modern and good for exercise.   there's no F&B at all, But they allow deliveries from Grab or Deliveroo.,Check in yesterday for quarantine order. First time ask for simple request but can't fulfill. The staffs mentioned one pillow will only be given for single occupant. Suggest me to ask my family members to bring for me. Totally can't sleep well for yesterday due to pillow issue.  Second, are we not allow to use bathtub?,We chose Dorsett Singapore for our anniversary stay this year. It was overall a great stay. Would like to thank all the staff from reservation, reception to housekeeping for the great effort to decorate the room which was a surprised for us. Love the drawing! Currently they are having a promotion which I think it's value for money. You may check them out if you plan to have a staycation. :)","Quiet,Modern",,,404,44,100

Great location with lots of good local restaurants in the vicinity, short bus trip to Toa Payoh central and also a wet market nearby for cheap groceries and local food. Hotel room was great, and just enough for 2, staff were helpful and went to lengths to help us.,Served stay home notice at Ariva for 7 days. We were lucky to have upgrade from 1 bedder (450sqf) to 2 bedder (650sqf) on the very high level with an fantastic unblocked view. Apartment is well maintained and equipped with fridge, washing and drying machine, microwave, toaster, cutlery, basically all you need for a comfortable and homey stay. The front desk manager and staff are very helpful and friendly to cater what we need during our stay. Highly recommend visitors who are looking for a place that is spacious, affordable and at a quiet yet in the city centre location. Though I could not go out during my stay yet I am sure plenty of food options available nearby, confirmed by my foodpanda delivery.,Went to Singapore for business trip, stayed at ariva on Shan for 3 weeks. Very nice serviced apartment/hotel. Walking distance to MRT, a few subway stops from all attractions such as orchard road and downtown. The apartment is clean and quite new, there is a little kitchen inside for some quick cooking, I really like the laundry unit inside the apartment, help a lot for my 3 weeks stay.,We are currently half way through a two week vacation in Singapore staying at Ariva on Shan. The location is excellent, just a short walk from Novena MRT. The apartment is lovely, clean and regularly serviced. Great shower in bathroom.. Light breakfast of pastries and toast available weekdays. We have had pool to ourselves every day so far :) Although bedrooms on the small side, and our 2 bed only had a sofa and table to seat 2 (has crockery for 4), we would definitely stay again.,Stayed at Ariva on Shan for about 20 days, and it was a very pleasant stay here. Great location, located away from the hub, but at the same time, very easy access. Well connected by both Bus and MRT. They even provide a shuttle to the MRT in the mornings.  Neat and well equipped apartments, and maintained very well by the staff. I would return to this property the next time I travel, for sure.",,,,98,7,82

BAD PEOPLE BAD EXPERIENCE,good place near MRT Station, so many restaurant but not for halal food, the receptionist helfully, the room very small, for moeslem theres no place for pray. many facilities such iron, hot water, tower for rent,Pros Locations near to Lavender MRT and Bendemeer MRT Stations. Near to Food Court (besides the hostel, across hostel) few of cute cafes next to the hostel, Seven Eleven and local minimart next to the hostel, Supermarket called Fair Price less than 1 km walk straight from the hostel. Mustafa Center and City Square mall by foot.  Our flight was at 10PM. We are allowed to leave our luggages at the hostel. and by the time we come back from our last sight seeing, they allow us to take a shower before leaving to the airport.  Cons No Elevator. Can be a bit difficult for someone who bring lots of luggages.,From Lavender MRT station, take Exit B. Once exit from escalators, take a right turn. Cross through 2 buildings via pedestrian crossings, go around Fair Trade and walk straight. The hostel is located at the end of the road on the right. Room was airy, beds and linens were clean. Air-conditioning works great, wifi speed was marvelous!  Had trouble sleeping on the second night (Saturday night) as our room window was facing the main road which had a pub. Music blasted until midnight. But other than that, all was fine. Do remember to bring along rubber slippers to go to the shared bathroom as water from the shower flows to the toilet cubicles.,We stayed at Pine Hostel from August 27 to 29, 2017. Check-inn time is 12 noon, however, they were very nice to let us check-in at 8 am with no additional charges. there is a simple breakfast every morning and during our last day, they let us leave our things in the hostel after check put so that we can still go around the city. we just went back to the hostel to get our things and head to the airport thru MRT.

Orchid Hotel,4.0,539 reviews,#128 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Korean, Malay","Share, ,The room rate and location is not bad but their service and handling are unbelievably poor.  The accident happened in the night, I came from good dinner and getting back to the room, but the room key doesn't work, so I get down to the front desk, they says they'll provide a alternative key card. However they keeps me waiting at the lobby more than 30min. Finally I could get a new key after 40mim, it is difficult to understand to keep guest wait very long time at the lobby in a midnight.   2nd story is more serious.  I sent my 4 cloths to the hotel laundry service on a first day, but it'll never return back me. I asked 3 times to the front desk but they keep says just ""just a moment"".  Finally, the hotel manager appears and he suddenly says ""we might lost your cloths, so let, solve this problem by money"" and then ""how much was your cloths?"" I dissapointed his attitude and he never says sorry for me.   Is this a hospitality of hotel? Location is very good, but their service and handling is very poor.  ,…,Stayed for 3 nights in December and had a great time. I requested 2 rooms adjoining which we got, so well done for that. The rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed. The pool was great. Very close to MTR so coming in from the airport is cheap and very convenient. Round the corner is a local food market which is busy, and very local... Further round there is a lovely street with bars, restaurants etc... There is a big 7/11 just round the corner too. We really liked the hotel, and being across the road from the MTR meant we could go anywhere easily.. Would stay there again,I stayed at the Orchid Hotel in May 2015. My previous stays in Singapore have predominantly been at the V Lavender. However, I had heard good things about this place. They were certainly not wrong. My stay was extremely pleasant in all aspects and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  Location: Very conveniently located 2 minute walk across the street from Tanjong Pagar station(east west line). There is a direct train from Changi Airport straight to this stop. To give perspective -  Its just two stops from Harbour Front; three stops from Bugis and merely 5-10 mins to get to Orchard.  Surroundings: The hotel is surrounded by eateries (predominantly Asian). So you are not without food here. The Maxwell Centre as well as hawkers market is about 5-7 minute walk away. However,, as soon as you exit the hotel, there is a variety to choose from I ate at the Japanese Gyoza and Ramen bar (very nice!). There are also an abundance of small cafes' if you want to have breakfast. Some nearby and some a short walk away. I would definitely explore! You will also find the usual convenience stores and fruit&veg markets.  Customer Service: Impeccable customer service in all aspects from the check-in staff and especially the concierge team. Who were ALL very helpful throughout my stay. They were able to advise about places to go; get a taxi to me very quickly! as well as help store my luggage while I was away in Vietnam. Really felt looked after.  The Facilities and Room: I didnt use the restaurant facility as I wanted to try the food locally. I also didnt use the gym or pool here so cant comment. The hotel doesnt have a drive-in as such, so the cabs will pull up at street level. Note: the concierge will definitely spot you and offer their help with luggage! The lifts were slow to arrive sometimes, but this was not a problem.  The room itself was very spacious (alot more than i expected in comparison to the V). Cleanliness was maintained throughout my stay in all aspects. A nice large bathroom and a walk-in shower - which was great! A really comfy bed and an working ""quiet"" A/C unit - bliss!  In conclusion, if you are looking for a conveniently positioned hotel; are on a budget and want to get around Singapore. This is the place to stay. Saying that, you are getting alot for your buck - bigger room; great service and a good location to start to do things. Ill definitely be staying here again.,…,This hotel is in a quiet part of the city but the MRT (Tangjon Pagar) on the East West line directly from the airport MRT is over the road (use exit A) so getting there and getting around is easy – the rooms are BIG - well-furnished and comfortable – everything worked – the staff were very helpful from arriving early to a 90 minute late check out – breakfasts were well prepared and lots of choices on the buffet. Chinatown is a 10 minute mostly undercover stroll and downstairs and nearby there are lots of great eating places – highly recommended.,With Singapore being no longer just a stopover destination, we booked into the Orchid Hotel for several nights so we could experience many of the famous attractions and local neighbourhoods that abound in this vibrant city.  The hotel is well located with an easy walk to Chinatown, markets, temples and a plethora of food options, all close by.  With only a minutes’ walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT, it provided ease of access to many of the well-known localities like; the shopping district of Orchard road, the bustling Little India, the famous Marina Bay Sands leisure complex including the Gardens by the Bay and so much more.  We had a very large, well-furnished comfortable room with modern decor, comfortable beds, a well-appointed bathroom, tea/coffee making facilities, free Wi-Fi and, plenty of storage space.  A daily buffet breakfast with a huge diverse selection of food styles, was included with our accommodation and is provided at the on-site, Orchid cafe.  The large outdoor pool, located on the first floor next to the restaurant and gymnasium, was a great place to relax and we mainly always had it to ourselves.

There was a large pool with jacuzzis and smaller pools on Level 1 and another pool and gym on level 7. Breakfast included each morning. Due to Covid pretty limited continental type breakfast and coffee machine only available from 7 to 10 which was unfortunate.  But better than not having it at all. Staff lovely and there is Kith Cafe inside residence available. Food is good but not particularly cheap. Great location. West Coast Park, one block away and next to waterfront. Great for children. Also, buses one block away either side depending on where you're going. And 5 min walk from West Coast Plaza and West Coast Market Square where there are numerous food stalls with cheap delicious meals and drinks.  Would definitely recommend.,…,Nice, clean and quiet place at West Coast; although no MRT station within walking distance, there were other amenities nearby at West Coast Food Centre, West Coast Plaza and West Coast Park; as COVID-19 restrictions were still in place, there was no dine-in breakfast but the pick-and-go breakfast had nice healthy selections for a non-fussy eater like me,Due to the Plandemic fake sweeping the world I found my self stuck in Singapore.

Awesome staff but they are not available between 12 pm and 7 am. Also a common issue with hostels in singapore u can only check in at 2 pm. A good point  unlike others they provide  free breakfast till 1 pm . Beds are bit congested but comfortable (as old setup). The caretakers are very helpful they guide u if u want to travel around. I could have easily stayed there for a month.,This place was a mess. The place was a horror! they did not seem like they new what they were doing. I walked into the back where we slept. I was shocked! it looked like a trash site. It was noisy and stunk like sweet and reecked like urine. Honestly i did not enjoy the acomidation. I was hot and eritated with the noise. I woke with a rash. The only actual good thing about it was the location. It was not run by kiwi's but a Arib who ripped of my dad knowing we would have to catch a flight.,We stayed 3 nights at the Sleepy Kiwi in March 2016, and we thought it was fantastic! Singapore is a very expensive city, so straight away the Sleepy Kiwi stands out as it is by far and away one of the best value for money places in town. I was so happy to discover when I arrived that this place is a 'proper' hostel, not one of these 'boutique hostels' that sadly have become more and more common over the last 10 years. The sleepy kiwi reminded me of the types of places I used to stay in when I first started travelling 14 years ago, big dorms where you can get to know people, wonderful friendly atmosphere, people actually talking to each other instead of being glued to their phones, and super friendly and helpful staff who have a wealth of information about the things to see and, do in Singapore. Also there are posters and other info all over the hostel about the places to go around the town.  Facilities are great, big kitchen, free wifi, free breakfast, plenty of sofas and an area right out on the street where you can chill have a beer and watch the world go by :) Location is top too, right in the middle of the Arab district on a pedestrianised street full of hustle and bustle, and most importantly full of the most delicious and good value cafés and restaurants. Also it's right round the corner from Haji lane, an eclectic and quirky shopping street a world away from the drab shopping malls of Orchard Road!  So if you're coming to Singapore for the shiny high-rise hotels, shopping malls, and the pampered life, probably best you go elsewhere. But for those of you who are here to explore, to discover, to meet people, and to enjoy the down to earth delights and quirky charm of the 'real' Singapore, then this is the place for you!,…,I have traveled in many Asian countries, and among all backpackers hostels, Sleepy Kiwi was by far the best. I especially went there for my very first time in Asia and I was very well welcomed. It was also the choice of many many exchange students for their first days in Singapore (before settling elsewhere for at least a semester).  As an exchange student in Singapore, I went there 3 times in 5 months (Aug., Dec. and Jan.), totaling 14 days. In a group or solo, I was never disappointed!  I would first of all mention the incredibly awesome staff, always available for you and super nice. While away, I missed Sleepy Kiwi's healthy breakfasts, along with a good coffee (for those who traveled to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, etc., you'll understand what a good coffee is ;)). Despite, negative comments here, there IS an atmosphere at Sleepy Kiwi, and it is nice. It is always sweet to have a break there, for they have cool playlists and you can chill on a sofa reading, or sharing experiences with other open-minded people (including the staff!). It is also sweet to have a drink at Sleepy Kiwi (fair price for beers especially - Singapore benchmark), sat on their benches on Bussorah Street (calm street) and chilling.   This hostel generally has a fair value for what they offer. The beds are ok, you can ask for a clean towel when checking-in. Upstairs and downstairs are showers and sinks, hot water included. They also have several computers with good wifi connection (at least 2 wifi spots in the hotel, so you also have it everywhere with your phone). What I also appreciated was their caring for their clients : shoes left downstairs to keep the ground clean, a notice asking people to stay quiet after 10 pm for the others, but mostly aaall the information they provide you with at the reception. You definitely get a good start for Singapore at Sleepy Kiwi, either you know what to do or you don't, thanks to the staff. The MRT (metro) is nearby and downtown is next door.,…,The only good thing about this hostel is just the locations which is near MRT station, near mosque (for Muslim), near cafes and boutiques and other cool shopping place and the breakfast, they baked me toast with jams that I can choose from chocolate to kaya toast, option between tea and coffee, and fruits, lots of fruits. And that's it, no more good things. I stayed in 14 bed room which is very very very small with lots of wooden divider so it feels very hectic (I was hoping for a big open room, not so big but at least doesn't feel like I'm running out of breath inside), the locker.. what locker? Just a small cabinet with broken key. The staff? Oh well when I said lost my sandals (yes I lost my sandals) he only said: oh I don't know. Wow.. very polite. I don't know where's my, sandals too, that's why I asked him. The toilet? Oh dear God, they only have 4 bathrooms for men and women. Wow, even at mall the toilet is separated for men and women. Will definitely not go back.,…",,,,458,80,100
Park Avenue Robertson,4.5,16 reviews,#115 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,A very good four star accommodation.  Our three bedroom townhouse was roomy and comfortable, however, there is scope for some improvement. It was almost a home away from home, with a laundry-drier in the townhouse, that can save you many dollars on laundry costs. Or if you want a laundry / dry cleaning service, Park Avenue provides this too.   Positives: Great value for our family of five. With the three bedroom townhouse having plenty of room, it beats having to find two hotel rooms, with one that probably only has a foldout bed.  Reasonable location – 15 minute walk to Orchard Road, bus stops five to ten minutes away, Clarke Quay MRT and Dhoby Ghaut MRT within walking distance. There are numerous places to eat in the area, especially along the river.  Remember though, this is, a tourist location so prices might be a little inflated compared to other parts of Singapore.  Groceries are available within walking distance - Cold Storage (UE Square), Meidi Ya (Liang Court), and a number of 7-11’s.  “Handy” phone – this is the best – free 4G cellular phone, with data, available for some free international calls too. Only downside is that it is a bit slow, has limited memory and didn’t seem to send or receive SMS -but WeChat and Skype is pre-loaded.  With this free house phone to use around Singapore, you won’t need to buy a tourist SIM card or rack up roaming charges.  You can also use it to buy discounted tickets to tourist attractions.   Neutral / areas for improvement. Whilst it might be considered nit-picking, some items below we find would improve the accommodation.   TV in master bedroom would bring the standard up a little.  Dishwashing liquid and laundry powder, although available upon request (according to the website) is not mentioned in the in-room compendium.  We think that for a serviced apartment, these are standard items that should not have to be requested but supplied by default.  Traffic noise may be a problem for some during the day, however, this was not really a problem at night time.  In the kitchen, cooking facilities are somewhat limited and cramped (combo oven/microwave, and two element cook top), and we would have liked a water jug to have been provided so we could keep refrigerated water in the fridge.  Tea and coffee was not available as advertised, but probably would have been provided if requested.  No soap holder in master ensuite which was a bit of a nuisance as there was nowhere to put soap and shampoo except on the floor.  The accommodation is clean and comfortable, although there was some significant damage to paint work in the lounge / dining room, and major cracking in the master bedroom.   The fitness facilities are within the apartment complex, and it would be nice if a key card were provided for the townhouse occupants so that they can enter at any time rather than when reception/security is around.  The swimming pool was nice, but very shallow (1.3m max).  We didn’t see the gym, but the website photos look impressive.     If arriving by taxi, make sure you mention the address (Kim Yam Road), as there are a number of other Park Avenue accommodation locations in Singapore, including the nearby Park Avenue Clemenceau, where our taxi dropped us off instead of Park Avenue Robertson.  Whilst we’ve stayed at nicer serviced apartments in Singapore, our Park Avenue townhouse was good value for money, and we would certainly consider staying here again. Perhaps next time, management will have considered and adopted some of our suggestions :) ,…,Have stayed in the apartments for more than 2 weeks. Very calm place for relaxing after busy business day in Singapore. Nice service! Quiet place! Herewith walking distance to MRT and downtown! Fair price. There are a lot of small stores (7-11 e.tc.) and supermarkets (Medi-Ya, Fair Price e.t.c.) are placed nearest to the hotel. 10 minutes walking from the hotel you can enjoy Marina Bay views! Great place for staying!,Stayed at apartments family of 6. Great location,  family friendly area.  5 min walk to Clarke quay Pool smallish but perfectly fine for the kids.  Bars and restaurants very close by.  Apartment spacious and clean.  Would recommended for large families.,Park Avenue Robertson wasn’t our first pick but we were unable to get an apartment as our usual spot on Penang Road. To summarise our stay:  THE GOOD It’s good value for money given we has 3 bedrooms and all with own bathrooms There is a washer/dryer Handy location to MRT and restaurants  THE NOT SO GOOD Each morning the kitchen was full of small cockroaches that must come up through the drains No hot water in the kitchen Pool was closed so had to travel to the other hotel for a swim (told on arrival) No access to reception as it’s always locked (you need to phone) Ad hock cleaning regime Unannounced comings and goings from staff to our apartment Door security (to apartment) is poor, no key cards here... We found it very noisy, especially about 5.30am,It's nice, clean and modern aparts, with kitchen and everything you need.  Also they provide good breakfast buffet, but you have to walk to another building for this.  Situation is right in the centre, but for MRT you need to walk quite long.",,,,193,27,97

Republic of Singapore Yacht Club,4.0,35 reviews,#11 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Stayed over here for about a week for business in the harbour area.   Very nice hotel, great outdoor place to sit and to eat. Food and entourage is great.  Nice swimming pool although I have used it, seen diving courses held in it.  The restaurant bridge bistro and beacon offers decent food for reasonable prices.  Service of the crew was quite attentive. In weekends the restaurant can be quite crowded so book a table in advance.,Been here a few times before and not too bad but on this occasion the restaurant was shocking. Booked the day before and came for pizza, arrived with my friend and we ordered a simple starter at this time no one said the pizza oven was broken. 30 minutes later we ordered a pizza only to be informed at this stage that the pizza oven was not working. Although we were very disappointed at this we were still hungry so we ordered the fritters di Calamri and the Antipasto Di Salumi. Big mistake, the calamari Although advertised as baby squid was like a tadpole with cod batter and full of salt and the buffalo morazzela, always a firm cheese was like a tyre.  We asked the very attentive staff if we could speak to the manager but he was very coviently pre occupied in a meeting, he could, about 12 feet from us and could not come and here out complaints.  If you are a pizza restaurant tell people your oven is not working before they sit down and if you are the manager don't hide.,…,My wife and I are staying at RYC Singapore for three weeks while visiting family in Singapore. Management were extremely helpful in arranging a booking during the COVID-19 crisis.  We have found the room, an apartment suite, to be very spacious and exceptionally well cleaned. The furnishings, comfortable bed,bathroom, spacious lounge with small kitchenette and excellent aircon make this an excellent choice for our long stay.  The fantastic gym and pool are also appreciated.  Our package included an excellent and generous daily breakfast.  We ate at both the Pizzeria, Italian restaurant and The Wharf on site and were very impressed with the food, staff and fascinating outlook over the busy marina and launch basin.  All the staff have been very helpful and friendly during our, stay.   We are fairly regular visitors to Singapore and wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else in Singapore now we have discovered this gem. ,…,Only had 1 night in Singapore and stayed here, located outside the hustle and bustle of the city, would need a car/taxi to get here as there is not near by MRT! Friendly staff and decently sized room! ,Solid Asian (Chinese) and Western dining options with the quality levels of a good RSL club in Australia. However, service efficiency and friendliness make this a better experience as well as the view over the local marina.  This is really a special experience to enjoy with friends. The Yacht Club is a place to enjoy the facilities at a 3/4 or so fraction of the cost of city center properties: Hotel, Restaurant & Bar. Swimming pool and gym on the property as well.  Food is 3*, the ambiance and service levels bring it up to 4*. No reason for a special detour for tourists pressed for time though...",,,,19,4,44
The Mitraa,4.5,239 reviews,#43 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,It was my first visit to Singapore and I chose this place since I knew very little about Singapore hostels. The room rate was cheap and we stayed in a female dorm. The dorm has bunkbeds and it was uncomfortable as well as the pillow. However the room got AC and close to Farrer Park MRT station.,Firstly the staff were some of the friendliest hostel staff I've met, very helpful even when I arrived at 2am! I liked that breakfast was included, and it's in a great location right near Little India and the Metro.,It's a small hostel but the location is good and staff are friendly. It has no lift or elevator so expect to carry your backpacks yourself. We stayed at 3rd floor and my friend had to carry her luggage bag on her own. Getting out of Farrer Station, take Exit B. I missed getting the name in Exit B, but it's not Race Course Road. Race Course Road is another exit. There are few people who get out of Exit B. Getting out of Exit B, turn right then turn left. Just walk ahead and there you will see the hostel. No crossing of roads.  It's a good choice and cheap for the price because there is free breakfast of toast bread with choices of fillings, coffee or tea and fruits.     For Catholics looking for a church, the nearest is St. Michael Church. Jerome, the Filipino staff in the hostel, can give directions.,…,The morning crew is great (Sebastian is the best) but I only had irritating  interactions with the evening guy. He made me fill-out redundant paperwork at 3AM with details they already knew  from my reservation, and despite taking a deposit from paypal, he sends me out on a 3km trip to the nearest ATM and  back to pay in cash. I pay, and he immediately asks me when I&#39;m leaving, sounding disappointed  when I said a time close to the checkout deadline. Get a card reader and lose the naggy attitude.,i book this hostel for 2 days at 24 - 26 september 2016 this is place is very cozy, good place to sleep.

But almost, it's the best hostel with cheap price.,Okay it's pretty basic here and not cheap, but it's as cheap as Singapore gets! The staff were nice, friendly and helpful and the dorms were big but they had a locker for each bed and it's a comfortable place to sit around for a couple of hours and the wifi is good. The general vibe of the place was pretty laid-back and easy going. If I was in Singapore I'd definitely go back.   Note: It also goes by the name 'Uptown Hostel'.

I was staying in this Alocassia Service Apartment. This service apartment is situated in a high end residential estate of affluent Singapore. It is just less than three minutes walk from the Steven Road MRT Station, the metro train of Singapore.  From this station it takes us only 2 stops to reach the famous Orchard Road where all the hotels, restaurants and shopping areas are. This service apartment is big and well furnished. It comes with a kitchen, bath, toilet, room for handing your clothes etc. it also has a nice swimming pool.  The person in charge of the apartment Mr Kelvin Ho is very helpful and friendly. All the staff in the apartment, from security to front office staff, from chambermaid to cleaners are also very pleasant.  Staying in, this apartment has made the trip to Singapore a very good experience.,…,Friendly staff and good facilties. However one of the cleaning staff seemed to be in a bad mood and not understand what we asked for. Location is excellent in terms of proximity to public transport and access to supermarket and fast food place.,Unfortunately had to alter plans so last minute change to Singapore. Apartment was great. Plenty of room to move around, close and convenient to MRT station.Good food options within building. Staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful. Bit weird going through McDonald's in and out but .....,Although not luxurious, this apartment suited our needs - spacious 1 bedroom with living/dining room, kitchen, bathroom, WC, walk-in closet (total 64sq m) and 5 mins’ walk to Stevens MRT.  It is quiet and light and the beddings are comfortable.  The kitchen comes with the necessary utensils, glassware and crockery but not the dishwashing liquid, sponge, table wipes. There’s a nice gym & small swimming pool. There’s no washer/dryer inside the apt but a common laundrette is available - chargeable for usage. ,Nice and well situated (3min to Stevens mrt), with some restaurant options and a small supermarket in the same building.

Draper Startup House Singapore,4.5,20 reviews,#97 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Go. For. It. I believe in everyone having a first-hand experience at this particular place. It's a tangibly + untangibly !!massive experience!! in Singapore. Enthusiasts from all around the globe buzz around Draper's as if it's a master hive for all varieties of honeybees looking to expand careers & startups. I'd wish to cut short this review here, and once again; go for it.,I booked Tribe Theory because I was travelling through Singapore on a work trip and wanted to engage in likeminded individuals in the evenings.  The first thing that made me feel welcome was the friendly member of staff on the counter. They explained the rules and rituals of the hostel simply and also showed me all of their upcoming meetup events, which was a nice bonus.  The events were great, I attended one about how to grow a data science team, and there were some robust debates amongst the audience and I was able to make some good connections.  I chose to stay in a queen bed – a unique offering – which was a great move. There was plenty of space to store my belongings and have a comfortable sleep, rather than being cooped up in a single. The pillows were the biggest I've, ever seen.  Everyone in the room was given a locker for free, which a a nice touch. Mine was a little janky, which wasn't great, but the hostel and area are very safe so I wasn't too concerned.  The breakfast was better than most hostels, as there was an unlimited supply of cereals, bread, eggs, fruit, juices and coffee / tea. They have a cool little egg cooking machine so you can make yourself hard or soft boiled ones easily.  There weren't too many guests staying whilst I was there, which was both a positive and a negative – I had my own space, but would've liked to have met more people.  A curious little feature was that they didn't allow shoes within the hotel – you leave them near reception. I really like this touch, as hostels are notorious for having muddy wet puddles over the property, but this wasn't the case with Tribe Theory.  The toilet and bathroom area, however, does need some updating. Having showers inside the toilet cubicles cannot be hygienic, and the wet floors aren't very pleasant when you just want to use the bathroom. The interior of the bathroom area just doesn't match the sleek brand they've created.,…,We stayed in the private room and both dorm rooms. The dorm room on the first floor was the worst because it's right behind reception so was a bit loud at times. The dorm room on the second floor was much bigger and quieter. The private room was very small and only had a bunk bed, hooks and a small window overlooking one of the common areas. The breakfast was pretty good for a hostel and the staff were nice. Overall, it was a decent experience and we would consider staying here again.,This is an amazing place. I booked for my solo traveller friend and she was floored with the services, neatness and the most amazing part is the location.. 500m to MRT and 10m to a nice hill park 100m to a Buddhist lovely temple and 250m to bustling busy Pagoda street for souvenir cheap shopping and sichuan food eating. Best of all was the caretaker Terence. To my solo lady traveller he gave early checkin and even gave complimentary taxi drop to airport seeing she had enough luggage. You dont get much of such people these days. God bless him.,I found the idea difficult to imagine, a hostel, for start-ups/entrepreneurs ... however it seems to work very well.  The individual pod bedroom was very comfortable and perfectly sufficient for my 4 night stay.  On the final night I had one of the most enlightening, entertaining and fun conversations of my life - chatting with other guests in the dining/common room/work area.  I found the staff great, pleasant and fun without being too intrusive.  The location is great (just under 10 mins from Metro station, and very close to hawker food)  The price was superb for Singapore and the whole experience met my needs perfectly.

Punggol Ranch Resort,4.0,16 reviews,#17 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Parking,,"Share, ,My hubby felt the plan to stay in Punggol Ranch was a little boring. So he decided just to send us there. We actually wanted to go Waterway Point for a brunch before check in in Punggol Ranch. However, since the carpark was full, so we just went to The Punggol Settlement. Sadly, the only halal stall was still closed in early afternoon, so we went to 7-11 to get some quick bites and walked along the seaside, watching ships, boats and people fishing. The breeze is nice and cool making us felt relaxing. The distance between Punggol Ranch and The Punggol Settlement is just a few minutes walk.  After some while, we went to check in in Punggol Ranch and was given the nearest chalet since we have young children, aged 5 and 7. The receptionist told us that the counter will be close, between 8pm to 8am, but there is a telephone number to call if require assistance. My hubby started to make himself comfortable to have a nap. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I brought my children for rabbits and horses feeding and I could purchase the food at a shop right to the end. Then my children went for a pony ride which was $10 per pax. Honestly, I found the ride is a little costly, but since we were already here, why not? I  could see the horses are well taken care as they are well-built and shiny, comparing with the horses which my kids had rode in Malaysia.  Shortly, after my friend had arrived, there was a small Malay event, about horse dancing beside Punggol Ranch. My hubby woke up and he got interested watching it and then he left us in Punggol. My friend and I bought our kids to The Punggol Settlement again for cycling. The children were having fun. We reached the entrance of Corny Island but did not enter because we were riding kart. Then we rode all the end to the other side of The Punggol Settlement until my mobile phone had turned to autoroam. We decided not to go any further as there were lesser people there and there were some men sitting at the seaside. Some of them went for swimming and were half naked. Feeling insecure, we hurried up rode back to the bicycle rental shop. Still not feeling hungry, kids went to the playground to play for a while. Then we went to Kampong Chai Chee Restaurant for our dinner. Dinner was nice, just that the Nestum Sotong which we ordered was a bit tough to bite.  After retuning the chalet, we put our children in the indoor playground, while my friend and I went back to our chalet to watch TV and chat. We felt safe for our children since our chalet and the indoor playground was so near and our children can just come to our chalet for toilet and a drink. The indoor playground was unlimited playing, since we did not bring socks, we need to purchase $3 for each pair of socks. That night was Christmas's Eve. All the chalets were fully booked and there were many BBQ outside. It was noisy and happening, but we like the surrounding amd atmosphere. After the kids had played for about 2 hours, they were tired and back to the chalet to shower and play board games which we have bought ourselves.  The next day, we need to check out by 11.30pm and we took bus number 84 to Waterway Point for our brunch and proceed to Safra Punggol for indoor water playground.  Overall, I am happy about Punggol Ranch, because my children didn't feel a moment of boredom. I didn't bought much cash but they accepted NETS as well. Even the activities were very simple, my children had enjoyed themselves very much. The chalet room and toilet were spacious. The external of the chalet was a design of horse stable which was unique. The furniture were wore off but I must say, comparing with East Coast Chalet, Punggol Ranch was much better and suits younger kids.  It is a pity that Punggol Ranch is going to close down soon in next year, but I am glad that I did not listen to my hubby and booked it before its closure.,…,Stayed here for 2D1N.

We went on a friday night and we settle our dinner at the nearby punggol settlement where there are a lot of restuarants and have the fusion-mookata (which is charcoal type so when you bbq, the fraqrance of the food is greatly enhanced!). There is also a nearby 7-11 where you can stock up on any food that you want. But for us, as we have a car, we went to the nearby waterway point mall to get some simple grocery. There is also a public bus stop at the ranch too!   Back to the chalet, the chalet is very spacious and can sleep a family of 4 and the toilet is very big! Got TV (but programme very limited) and fridge but i have a few comments for, the management to take note. 1) the spring mattress can be improved as after one night of sleep (i am on the heavy side), i have some minor back pain 2) There should be morning breakfast available which i am not sure where to get  Sat morning, we laze around the chalet before we went to see their other parts of the farm and we excited to try their pony ride and feeding the horses, rabbit. they have many other attractions like art and craft corner, small indoor playground, horse riding, rock climbing, archery etc wanted to try out their Karaoke in the boat but think no time.Lunch at other areas of punggol as we have a car. In the afternoon, we walk over to the punggol settlement to rent a bike and explore the coney island and meet a family of otters! For dinner, we went to Leong Ji for some of the local food and i think the price is reasonable.  After dinner, i went to put my mum and my son to rest and me and my wife went to the punggol ranch to have some light satay. After satay, we hop to the wild j's bristro which is beside the halal restaurant to do listen to some live singing which is very nice and we relax by having some light beers and snack before we head back to the chalet for a rest.  Sunday we check out and think overall is a good experience!,…,We love this place..with horses, rabbits and all friendly staff. There is sea nearby and Coney island where you can walk or rent bicycle.

The room is fairly clean   I give this a two thumbs up 👍👍,Everything else is quite disappointing and quite disgusting - nothing like the pictures shown. I stayed there for 4 nights and it was a mistake. The only value from this place is the close proximity to a few MRT lines and Bugis area.   I stayed in the Attic storey, which was on the 3rd floor. The room is divided into two, so each half shares a bathroom. My half consisted of 6 beds, two fans, and a half-decent air conditioner. Here are a few major things to complain about:  SPACE - Not much place for you to put your things in such a small space; just a small shelf and a couple hooks if they aren't broken. I ended up hanging my wet towel and sweaty clothes on my bed frame and posts. I highly recommend renting a locker to be safe from pests and theft.  PESTS - On the last night, I, found that there is a pretty serious rat infestation. My backpack was gnawed through by rats. I found out that they were actually attacking my bag and made a gaping hole, I threw the snacks into the waste bin, which they then later started attacking. At least five or more fought over the food all night long. I brought it up to the front desk (who I'm guessing is the owner/manager) when I checked out in the morning that there was a pest problem. He just smiled at me and said nothing because there were other people who came in to check in. I uploaded a photo of my eaten bag.   CLEANLINESS - Given that there is a major rat problem here, you should be careful everywhere. Don't walk barefeet. Fortunately, the sheets, pillows, and blanket looked and smelled clean. The bathroom was ""cleaned"" every two days. There were used shampoo bottles and garbage from previous guests in the room and bathroom floor the whole time I was there. The toilet paper wasn't replaced. Not much space to put your belongings in the bathroom to avoid getting soaked. There is a huge musty smell throughout the place from the lack of ventilation.   SIMCARD - The hostel says they would provide a simcard to use during your stay. They didn't get any new simcards and the existing ones were expired.,…,The room was converted from a utility room with the bathroom smaller than a closet. At first all seems decent except for the price. The elderly man at the front desk meets you with a smile. The bed is as comfortable as a dish sponge, the room smells like the sweetness of sickening urinal tablets. The air conditioning is weak at best. At an outrageous $90 a night you would expect some basics, but alas you are left wanting. Wanting a bed sheet, because there are none. Wanting a towel after a shower, got to pay extra for that! Want a universal plug in the wall, nothing like that because you have to rent it. Then in the morning I was just a few minutes late for breakfast and the kind faced owner says ""Sorry closed"". I respond like a beggar, ""Any leftovers?"", and he says again ""Sorry, it is closed"". Started the day out disappointed with the place, the service, the setup, and the service of selfishness.,…,Booked this budget-friendly HOSTEL w/ private bathroom for 4pax. BIG CHECK ON PRIVATE BATHROOM, we prefer private bathrooms than common ones.  It's not as clean as hotels but it's better than what most reviews portray it to be. We stayed in a family room in the 1st floor, no window room though but 1 queen bed and 1 double deck.  It's spacious, with mirror and cabinet for things. Not the cleanest cabinet, if you are particular.  Bathroom is good enough w/ working  heater. Their blankets have seen better days though (they look more like towels, the one I got); sheets changed once in 5 days. Trash emptied every day but bathroom tissue not replenished. Sockets everywhere so no problem charging phones/laptops. We have 5 dual electrical outlets in our room for 4 people.  Room needs, improvement on cleanliness (smells musty; there's an exhaust but not as enough) but we're out the whole day and for its price, THIS IS A STEAL.  We'd rather spend SGD120 (5D/4N) we saved for food. Various food choices nearby.   Location is exceptional as it is smack in the middle of Jalan Besar (via Upper Weld Road) and Rochor Stations (Turn right to Perak St and the MRT is there!). We did DIY walking tours in the 3 early mornings to Mustafa, Tekka Centre, Kampong Glam, Haji Lane, and Bugis. Very accessible to cheap local food as well; hotel 1.5L water is cheap.  Breakfast is coffee and toast with peanut butter, jam, and butter. Towels need to be rented with deposit.  The owner and staff are accomodating.  It’s a hostel so don’t expect it to be top notch but we’re okay with it since we are out the whole day. OH, AND OWNER GIVES FREE 500MB SIM CARD.,…,I was looking for rooms for 5 persons & 4 persons in a convenient location to the city when I stumbled across this place. I found other accommodation for a similar budget price but this was the only one with a private bathroom & was close to two MRT stations. I was also able to book a 13 seater shuttle bus to pick us up at the airport through contacting the hostel. On entering the arrival hall at the airport the driver was waiting for us holding up my name. After a short walk to the shuttle bus we loaded our luggage & set off for the city. On arrival at Kawan we unloaded our luggage & I paid the driver S$60. Our check-in was very easy also paying for the rooms in S$. Our rooms were on the second floor & we had to use the stairs. The room was a bit cramped for 5 & the Windows, were shuttered making it very dark. The room had air conditioning & a fan, so as long as you can sleep at night & take a shower morning & night, I prefer to use the money we saved on daytime activities. We could buy discounted tickets  for attractions from reception plus we could buy cold drinks which was a godsend after coming back from a hot day. I do not recommend this hostel for families with young children but those with teenage children like ourselves & looking for a budget price I can certainly recommend it. There are many Indian restaurants & bars in the area. Our favourite was the Countryside cafe. We took the MRT back to the airport, I chose to get on at Rochor station, although the journey was a little longer than if we had got on at Jalan Besar station but it was easier to get to the platform with our luggage. 1 transfer at Expo station & direct to the airport.,…",,,,276,52,100
CUBE - Boutique Capsule Hotel @ Kampong Glam,4.5,390 reviews,#17 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Actually traveled in January 2020. The hotel is in the heart of the Kampong Glam area which is a bit of a walk from the Bugis and Rochor stations but it's very near bus stops on either side which made it convenient. Check-in was a breeze and they let me leave my luggage with them because I arrived early. Came back at check-in time and was assisted with my luggage up to the 6-person room where I took a top bunk/capsule. Staff carried my luggage up to my capsule and I was surprised that it fit! There's a small space beside the mattress for it and there is also a rack for hanging clothes or towels. The other side of the mattress had a fold-up table with a mirror where I can prepare and use my laptop when needed. The bed was cozy, had two pillows, and had a night light too. No need, for adapters because the sockets were universal. Always had a good night's sleep there.  The bathrooms were spacious (you get T&B's instead of just showers and sinks I think, I didn't see those at the time I was there) and luckily other guests were diligent enough to do their best to tidy up after themselves. There's a shoe locker on the floor too. I left my earphones on top of it one morning and came back in the evening and it was still there thankfully. Had some noisy roommates who talked loudly on their phones in the room so be prepared for such instances just in case. Upon check out, I also asked one of their staff to help bring down my luggage and bags from the top bunk and they were happy to help.  The breakfast was pretty ok, I remember having cereals, bread, jam, chocolate spread, boiled eggs, coffee, and juice. Remember to clean up after yourselves after eating, they won't clear the tables for you. Their staff are great and friendly and I would stay there again if I go back to Singapore. Great budget option without sacrificing comfort and convenience.,…,Great location, it's nice to have some privacy which the cubes offer. Staff were very friendly! Only the bathrooms weren't very clean, but they were renovating some of them so hopefully this will improve! ,Nice place,clean toilet,warm hospitality,room it's clean and comfort,easy to check in and check out Especialy for me because I'm muslim located realy nice near from mosque and easy to find halal food's,cube that is very clean and quiet, easy installation, maintain the existing and increase more that is lacking, such as the addition of a room temperature regulator that is too cold so that the temperature regulation is provided in each room,It’s hard to fault this place. Found a cheap deal on Agoda just over £20. Very clean and secure. Breakfast is basic and unexciting but it exists which at the price is great. Washing machine available for free and showers and toilets clean and well maintained. Some guests are amazing and others are at best inconsiderate but that’s not the fault of the friendly helpful staff. ","Trendy,Centrally Located",,,459,80,100
S Inn @ ChinaTown,4.5,394 reviews,#30 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,This hostel is located on Hong Kong Street which is within walking distance to China Town, multiple MRT stations and plenty of awesome restaurants. Dorms were clean and breakfast was available to make yourself in the shared kitchen. ,This accommodation is close to the MRT but it can be difficult to access it because the street is flooded by people (chinatown). We didn't have a window so the place was very dark. The bed was not good and when itried to use the mattress under my bad it was not clean. The toilets are open to the street so it was often dirty. The showers are good. There is a place where you can have breakfast but which is to small to meet people. You can live there for a few days but not if you are looking to meet new people.,We had a booking as family. It has a excellent booking review at Booking.com. But in reality, It is the most worst nightmare place I ever booked in our travel.  I dont even understand WHY this hostel got good review but its definitely not.  We are very disappointed to see the exterior place which full of vandal and trash out side.  And yet,  We were able to come inside without security.  They asked us to remove our shoes before entering the reception area which our shoes will might be mixed up to others. The receptionist has no good service. She seems angry when We were able to enter without us knowing the door code.   What We also dont like is that there is no privacy.  Toilet and shower room is common to all.   We also dont feel secure upon hearing that there is no, receptionist incharge aftr 5pm. No good service. No security. Overpriced hostel. ,…,After 2-3 yrs of not staying in hostels, I m amaze with the number of families  that are staying in hostel. Convenient location for food and transportation, besides the heritage town.  The only downside is if you are paranoid of walking bare footed on the floor please bring your own bedroom slippers, I really don’t mind walking bare footed, but the problem is not all guests adhere to their regulations of removing your shoes.,Pros: Location - near MRT, lots of gift shops and food stalls nearby, instagrammable murals on the street. Cons: The lobby and pantry smells feet and cigarettes! Tiny toilet and showers! There's a separate bathroom stated in our room when we booked. Imagine our horror when it is actually shared and worst they don't provide even a cheap towel! They said it's budget friendly. I don't think so. We paid more than 200$ and it's not even worth it. Will I recommend this to my family/friends? Absolutely not.","Centrally Located,Budget",,,725,111,100
MET A Space Pod @ Chinatown,4.0,30 reviews,#103 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Stayed here for 4 nights in Pod 3.  The hostel can be difficult to spot on the street because there is no front entrance, only a lift. The signs for the hostel are hung around the walls and columns opposite the lift.  Check in was just the standard stuff and straightforward. Shoes aren't allowed inside the hostel and there is a locker just outside the reception for everyone to store their shoes. Inside, there's two bathrooms, one each for boys and girls. The pods are located in one of two dorms and your pod is numbered so you'll know which dorm to go to.  I've stayed in many capsule hotels before, but this was just about the most packed I've ever been in. Not so packed you it's difficult to move, just a lot of pods. For some odd reason the pods aren't numbered sequentially, so, it was a bit confusing trying to find my pod. If you've stayed in a space pod before, this is the same setup. The capsule is designed like a space capsule and lit in funky blue and white light. Inside there's a universal electrical socket and two USB charging points. There's also a small face mirror and a foldaway table. The mattress is thin, firm and asian style, and the pillow is thick. The blanket was plenty warm against the AC.  The card you get to unlock your pod also unlocks a locker. This is big enough to hold a medium to medium-large backpack.  The gents bathroom had a shower room, a toilet and one combined shower/toilet. These are amongst the most cramped toilets and showers I've ever used, but that's Singapore for you. They're always clean and fine to use, and that's good enough.  A self service breakfast is provided and by the standards of capsules and hostels, the breakfast is great. You get a choice of cereals, toasts, jams, tea, coffee and juice.  Location wise, the hostel is right in the heart of Chinatown l, where there's an endless choice of great places to eat and there are several attractions within walking distance too. For anything else, the Chinatown MRT and bus stop are within 5 minutes walk. The transport system in Singapore is comprehensive, it'll get you anywhere anyway.  The staff here are great. All are friendly and helpful.  Overall, I had a great stay. For the price paid and what you get, there's nothing to complain about.,…,I am a single female who was in Singapore for 3 nights. The capsule had plenty of room and was very clean. I have traveled all over the world and stayed in hostels and capsule hotels before. I understand it comes with noise etc of sharing a common area. But some of these pods come with TVs. I did not have one but the person next to me did. It was EXTREMELY loud. They watched tv till after 1 am every night. I could hear what they were watching, not just that they had a tv on. It sounded like the speaker was coming into my room. That was my only complaint. I feel like if TVs are going to be in these then people should have to wear headphones or be more respectful of the volume. ,Our family stayed 8 nights.  Aaaaannndddd sleep was close to nothing due to the loud pod neighbors.  It was so bad my 15 year old daughter had to make her own signs using google translate to Chinese requesting pod mates to obey the rules!  I requested on several occasions to get new linens to sleep on and towels to wash my body.  I’m still waiting... I observed in the ladies room, hair in drains, mildew, and can you say SAUNA!!  For me, their beds were not comfortable.   On a positive note, the concept is very cool, the pods will bring out the kid in everyone, and the do-it-yourself breakfast was a bonus!   This location is amazing, located in the belly of Chinatown “Smith” street - food heaven!    This was my experience, I hope yours is better!  ,Room is very clean, very near to the MRT station, has a lift, and the bedsheet, towel are clean, just need to turn on more light at night in the lobby, a bit dark .For sure I will stay in this pod for the next time visit.,Easy to find place in Singapore Chinatown. Great area for those loving food and the Chinese market feeling. They are all around. Using the elevator to get upstairs, the first Space Pod experience began. Check in was decent, the place is clean, everyone understands the “be quiet” and “no shoes” rules. Breakfast is simple, but perfect to kick-off the day and hold you until lunch. The staff is helpful and kind. Highly recommend the place and the area. It is also close to the center and other attractions. All together, I loved the experience.",,,,806,127,100
Pillow Talk,4.0,134 reviews,#99 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese","Share, ,The location of the hostel is only 500m from lavender MRT or a slightly longer walk to Little India. Hostel itself was clean and quiet. Can’t really go wrong for the price. Everyone in the hostel keeps to themselves. There’s 24 hour self service toast, tea and coffee which is handy. Would’ve been nicer if there were more bathrooms but restricted due to Singapore law’s apparently. ,One very rude staff member and  unhelpful when they refused to make up for their mistake.   They washed the sink with chloride and left it without cleaning it up, so a new dress got ruined.  We felt that it was a little unfair that the hostel would get away with a simple ""sorry"". It was like they didn't show any regret.  So later that evening we whatsapp one of the staff, and he said that the hostel don't take any responsibility. We didn't like the lack of interest for making up, but ok..  So after a short time, we got a text from the hostel.. About ourself. The text was intended for some other in the staff, saying at he is watching Netflix and playing games and telling us names. He didn't give any interest to be nice. We felt that it was extremely rude.   First and last time I, ever stay there.,…,After one in the Staff had cleaned the bathromm (which i learned after) he had left masses of chloride floating around the sink. As the sink always had been floated with water I Just thought it was Just that. So Fter washing my hands, lesning towards the sink, my New dress got completely ruined by the strong chloride and my skin started itching. When i told the Staff (Steven) he was ok at first but when i WhatsApp ed asking for any compensation or at least an apology, he was rude, sarcastic and basicaøly calling me stupid for using the sink. He Even wrongsended a message to me laughing about me, calling me by ny name and saying i was nasty. I thought it was so unproffesional for someone to be have in that way.  Other than that, the whoøw hostel is monitorer by cameras so you, always feel supervised. Its only two bathrooms which keeps them always occupied.the rooms are not what They look like in the pictures, the WiFi Does not work in the rooms, its not allowed to talk or Even drink water in the rooms and there is No suitable area to hang out or relax. I would never stay here again.,…,plus points: -near to 2 MRT stations: Lavender (green line) and Bendemeer (blue line) which is pretty convenient in terms of transportation -very good location: won't be noisy at night, quite a lot of food nearby (hawker center, subway, mcd, toast box...) -friendly staff -clean bathrooms -drinking water supply (hot/cold) -hairdryer provided -price is reasonable  some downsides: -pillow is too soft for me -blanket is too small -it gets very dark until you cannot see anything when the lights are off -shoes need to be placed in the shoe rack outside of the room, personally feel a bit insecure with it. slippers are provided but not very clean, also someone else placed their shoes in my shoes rack on 2nd day of my stay -no hanger is provided -only 1 socket for each bed which is a, little bit too less, luckily I brought my universal adaptor with 2 USB sockets so I can charge my phone and power bank at the same time  overall with the price paid I'm satisfied with my stay :) ps: $20 deposit is required when you check in, refundable upon check out,…,Plus Points : - Near to Bendemeer / Lavender MRT Station ( around 5-10 mins walking ). You can travel around Singapore from both stations. Looking for bus shelter is easy as well.  - Near to minimarket (go to Hao's to find lovely snacks and sweets, Fairprice and 7-11 are alvailable also for 24-7) - Easy to find your food. From early breakfast to late dinner, thats not a problem (go to Kopitiam under V-Hotel Lavender, i love this place). The hotel is surrounded by apartments with each food stalls on its ground floor.  - Friendly staff, easy checkin. - Located in quiet neighborhood. Next to this hotel are temple (a small prayer house) and hardware shop. I love sitting outside the window and watching local activity. - Reasonable price - The hot water works well.  - Large lockers, under bed. It fits medium to large luggage i thought.   Minus Points : - Average cleanliness of bed linens. I could accept a couple of hair and a tiny spider strolled around the bed. As long the bed wasnt stained or wet. - Bad smell near the sink. I thought there was a clogging or something in the drain. Like most budget hotels in Singapore, this place is an old shophouse refurbished. - The back door always open during the day. Its not a big issue for me, i thought its a small behaviour of Asian culture, but perhaps not all guest staying can understand this and will get insecure. - Poor shoe cabinet. Bad smell (from my shoes also, lol) is strong enough. Better use closed shelving.,…",Budget,,,254,24,94

The location couldn't be any more perfect its literally 10 steps away from Chinatown and a 2 minute walk to the MRT.

So I went to the premises to check out the property but I was not allowed in, unless I made an appointment. So I asked for a date to visit to view the apartment.

When I arrived, realize it’s not in the app or in email and I had to try to contact the apartment for the pin so that we can enter.  2) wifi password was not provided automatically. During our stay, I realized it’s not in the email so I asked them for it. They only replied after we checked out.  3) the clock was out of order and they didn’t bother to fix it.  4) hair dryer was out of order too.  5) security deposit if $500 was deducted from my credit card without informing me or seeking my permission.  6) toilet floor was wet throughout the stay due to some leakage from pipe or what.  7) no one at the front desk throughout the stay, so we could not seek assistance for the issues we, encountered.  8) we even had to dispose the thrash ourselves ! ,…,This is party central!!

You will not get any sleep as this is a well know place for people to rent by the night for a party, and there is always broken furniture outside the day after and rats taking food from the overflowing bins. Cheap but you get what you pay for and I do not recommend ... oh an no refund!,Located right at the bottom of a lively street filled with restaurants, clubs and people on weekends. A couple of steps from a convenience store, one block from Chinatown, within walking distance from Marina Bay Sands, several subway stops nearby. Spacious and well equipped (including toiletries, although we had not been expecting them based on booking.com description). Aparently it's a historic building, which implies some quirks, but overall a very pleasant experience. Easy self-check in/out. Taxi stand in front, but the cabs don't stand there all the time - they just stop if in the neighborhood.

Lotus at Joo Chiat,4.5,22 reviews,#128 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Wifi,,"Share, ,I recently read the review ""what a nightmare"" about Lotus. I am the father of the noisy kids. Yes the kids were very noisy, I agree with Topsmom on that. Many kids from many different countries run around and make noise and fight and live life. This is what is so amazing about Lotus and the reason why we have lived there for 5 years and will continue to live there for 5 more. If you don't like noisy kids, then you should not come here. Sometimes I come downstairs and there are 6 kids in my living room and 3 in the fridge in the kitchen. I like that, but it isn't for everyone.  Side note: I confronted the husband after he was speaking in a rude, derogatory and disrespectful way to our domestic helper. There is no excuse for that, and I did say 'if you don't like kids running, around playing and making noise then you should probably move out'.   Some places are good for relaxed, chilled out families who enjoy each others' company, welcome newcomers and love to eat and drink and chat until late and let the kids play and go into each other's houses and use each other's pool toys without asking :), and other places are good for people who have high expectations, like to relax and be pampered and don't like too much noise. If you are the latter, you won't like Lotus@joo chiat.,…,I came here for an 6 month stay, whilst I had a very intense period of work in Singapore, near Bedok. The location is fab for access to the MRT east west and circle lines station Paya Lebar and east west line Eunos. The 33 bus passes the front door, which runs between Kent ridge and Bedok, and so gives easy access to or links to the whole island.  Over the road from the apartment is a fab 24hr Wanton noodle bar, within a few hundred meters are several other fab local and international restaurants, and a little less than 1km from east Coast road, which is a wash will local, traditional and international bars, cafes, hawkers, restaurants etc.  The East Coast Park is always in easy reach, which has stunning sea, beach and park views, on which one can walk, run or cycle straight all, the way along the coast, up to the airport to the east, with views of aeroplanes coming in to land, or west into the city, via the gardens by the bay, over the barrage on the boundary of the sea with the bay, and past the marina bay sands hotel, the views at the city are stunning as you approach.  I was here on my own, but with frequent family visits, so being here alone it felt great to be surrounded by families, yes there are lots of children here, but they are no problem, and to be honest after a busy week of work it nice to here the sound of family life. There ex pat here from all over the world, which is nits self a great education, the majority of people say hello and speak and make you welcome, which I absolutely welcomed. Many of the residents organised gatherings, parties, celebrations many times, and all were welcome, which was great.. As you'll see by the photos the facility is based around of beautiful colonial singapore shop houses, with a more modern apartment block behind, which is built, decorated and furnished in a very traditional style. Below the building is a huge car park, dedicated for the apartment, where you can park you bike or car, but was is very under used.  I had a ground floor, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, apartment, with a lovely decked area which overlooks the beautiful garden between the new block and shophouses, that connects all together and creates a great community environment. Having the ground floor apartment provided me with space outside to park my bicycle.  The apartment was cleaner twice a week, with clean bed linen and towels each time, which was great for me being so busy at work.  There's a nice leisure pool and small gym, outside there's a covered area with tables, next to gym, should you wish to have a social gathering on a wet or particularly hot day, there's a small children's play area and adjacent seating area, there's even a large BBQ area (chargeable).  The apartment had good strong WiFi, cable TV, HiFi, all kitchen pot, pans & cutlery, oven, gas hob & elect hob, fridge freezer, iron, ironing board, washing machine, tumble drier, kettle, toaster, plus the bathrooms are provided with shower gel / shampoo, all of which save a lot of hassle for the business traveller... :-)  The staff were always polite and happy to help, they treat their as guests as well as friends, which again is most welcome when stationed here on my own so long. During my stay I only had one or two very minor issues with small parts of my apartment, but the management made sure everything was sorted quickly and properly, no messing about and no arguments.  Monday to Friday (not public holidays) there is a more than adequate buffet breakfast (toast, cereals, tea, coffee, juice and fruit) which is great, and is served until 10am, I'd vote for the same on weekends too.  Overall I was very happy, comfortable, welcome and impressed with this facility, and if the opportunity arrives again I'd be nosy too pleased to return.,…,Very unprofessional service staff. This place is like a giant day care with screaming kids and inconsiderate tenants at pool area till wee hours, Despite the house rules regarding peaceful and tranquil environment, nothing is enforced.  During check in, was told to go through the inventory checklist on my own.I was almost electrocuted by their faulty hair dryer. And their response was :"" Oh, we'll change a new one for you."" The washing machine had a mouldy smell and I requested to have it changed. They did this when no one was at home (permission was given to enter with no one in) But  upon returning to the apartment, there was a foul odour throughout. And we searched for the source. And to my utter horror, it was coming from the replaced washer. And the drum was filled with, grime.  The noise situation came to an unacceptable level that my husband went to speak to the kids' dad. His response was "" if you don't like it, you can move out!"" We contacted the management and feedback all our issues to them. All they could do was say it was all a misunderstanding and they will inform the guards to be more vigilant ) as there is no service staff after 6pm) MISUNDERSDTANDING??? Upon checkout, we signed all the necessary papers and all was in place. I received a phone call from LOTUS the next day accusing me of stealing their kitchen appliances!! That's when I lost it and said: Do your job properly and search conscientiously before you accuse your tenants!! My experience is exactly like what I've mentioned above and no exaggeration on my part. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to stay with good service, DO NOT STAY @ LOTUS. The only good thing was the location as it is  in a quaint neighbourhood with lots of beautiful architecture around. And not forgetting the great cheese shop across.,…,We spent 4 weeks in a Superior Nonya suite at Lotus.  As a family of 5, it gave us plenty of space and the apartment had all the amenities we could have possibly wanted. The pool is small, but perfect for a family dip and was generally not busy at all.  We used the small gym on a daily basis - the equipment seemed fairly new and very well maintained. The small playground and surrounding gardens were perfect for our children aged 9, 6 & 18 months.  It was safe and yet they were able to run about and explore. The icing on the cake at Lotus, are the staff.  Divine, Bea and Jamie, in particular couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming to us.  The guards on the gate were also lovely to the children - allowing them to feed the fish and making sure we had taxi's when we requested, them. Lotus is a fabulous oasis of calm, set in the interesting Katong district  - we absolutely loved it there and will definitely be back one day.,…,Great building, fantastic staff and service. But the little ex pat kids are super loud and running around unchecked. It is noisy from 8 am every day until after 7 pm ever night. Don't come here for peace and quiet or to sleep in on the weekends. BUT... if you have your own kids to run around with the others it's great. But feels more like a giant day care center than a serviced apt.",,,,84,10,91

Felt privileged as this facility is mariner’s exclusive. Prices are very fair if you compare rest of hotels in singapore. Outram MRT is just 400 mtrs, Always Use exit towards Police headquarters, Cantonment road side ( i guess exit F). Spore attractions very close by from outram, harbour front is next stop from where you can head sentosa via vivo. Rooms are spacious, however repainting is required. Food can be ordered through honestbee app, use rear entry for delivery. For double occupancy room, they give separate beds, thats bad. No cooking allowed in room. Ac is preset to 23 deg, no remote. Reception crew is great & well behaved. Locker facilities For luggage is provided free of charge. From now onwards, I am, gonna stay here always on my spore trip.,…,First of all this place can be awailed only by seafarers, its priced very economical for Singapore. U aactually get serviced apartments, but no cooking allowed. Its close to Outram park MRT station, so going around is very easy.  i used Cab only for arriving at the place , otherwise I used MRT even to reach Airport on my departure. Clarke Quay is jus a couple of stations down , by Cab will cost u less than 6 SGD.harbour front is jus one station down.Chinatown is ten min walk, .    The rooms are clean and cleaned everyday.linen, bed and sleep quality is fantastic. On the con the aircon is preset to 23C and takes time to cool down.There is no remote to switch OFF Aircon in the living space , so waste of energy when u r not using. Dint try the restaurant , But I saw a lot of people, comin in to use the restaurant , so i guess its good too.  Reception was run quite smoothly , quick check IN and Check out.they r very strict about checkin and out timings, but they have a luggage locker which i used to check out early so that i can use more time for sight seeeing on the last day.and its Free.   There is Billiards table , free wifi only in lobby level, and a mariners lounge. Cant ask for more for this price in Singapore.,…,We stayed with my family for 3 nights & 4 days and iccupied 2 rooms, one for us couple & another for my 3 daughters. The room rate is reasonable & cheaper compared with hotels in Singapore. Room is very spacious & well cleaned. There us also a good restaurant at the ground floor which serves excellent food & friendly staff. The drawback in this place is the location. It is away from downtown area & shopping malls therefore not convenient for the average tourist as it entails a walk of around 500 meters to the nearest MRT station.,It was fairly easy to book, which I did while at home in India(Kolkata). I simply had sent couple of mails which includes one amendment of arrival date. However, it was quickly acknowledged by the club's officials. The unit which was allotted to me was consist of a large bed room with two single beds,one sitting room with one three sitter and two one sitters sofa settee  and a large led TV with many popular tv channels, including BBC and CNN etc, an attached toilet with dry and wet area ,hot and cold water for 24 hours, a pantry with basin and a fridge.  and I paid only Singapore $102.50 per day. This same unit in other place will never be less than S$ 250 or may be more. It has an attached restaurant on the ground floor but that is really expensive but across the street behind, the opposite buildings there are numerous shops and eating joints. There are 24 hours open shopping area where one can get anything require for day to day stuffs and all. The nearest MRT station is outram park within walking distance max 5 to 7 mins away, china town is equally the same distance , the ....... it is available to only for the Merchant Navy personnel and their families.,…",,,,434,39,98
Prince of Wales Backpacker - Boat Quay,3.5,153 reviews,#100 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Booked to stay in Townsville room for two night.  Some of the issues we had where:  Hearing people in other rooms like they where in same room. This was in part due to a strange flimsy ""wall"" behind the bed head.  Room smelt musty and could use very good clean.  The bed is shot, springs in back and badly curved in and sunken.  Average customer service, rooms served through bar area.  Location is alright(can walk to marina bay, bugis, Chinatown etc.) but strip of restaurants and bars on front quite crap in my opinion.  Typical overpriced tourist strip.  Overall, not good value at all. We left after 1 night and managed to stay in number of much better places that where only a little more expensive when we stayed there.  For example much better rooms for about 100 at days hotel and, value hotel Thompson.   ,…,I have been VERY disapointed by this hostel.  First of all, the guy who welcomed us was not pleasant at all and didn't make any effort with his english to let us understand and when we asked him to repeat just to make sure we really understood, it seems to really annoyed him !!!    Secondly, we found the room very expensive for the basic stuff we found inside, no private bathroom and very noisy during the night !!! It really didn't deserve the price we pay!!! The breakfast was also very limited.    I think the staff really need to make effort if they want backpakers to come again. It is really a shame because the location is very nice and the bar included in the hostel is very pleasant, but the staff really need to improve the way they welcome their guests !!!,It was my first time to stay at Singapore hostel. Too bad on my first day, I and my friend should experienced problem on our internet online booking. It was said there was a problem on my online booking system so the hostel only could accomodate one of us. We decided that I would stay in the Prince of Wales hostel and my friend would find other place to stay.  This hostel is very excellent in term of location. Staff/Manager are also kind and helpful. I really love the shower, clean and the shower run very nice. Suppose we didn't face problem on online booking. It would be perfect for me to stay in hostel for the first time.,We stayed here for 4 nights in 2007 for $15.00 each per night.  It was an excellent hostel by hostel standards.  The rooms were cozy with 3 bunk beds.  We stayed at a hostel before this one that had 14 bunk beds per room, which was a little too busy for us.    There was a great bar downstairs that had a pool table for everyone to use.  There was comfy seating where you could relax with a book or a beer.  Everyone was friendly here and the food was excellent for a hostel.  The location was definitely great because it was in little india.  The food in the surrounding restaurants was always excellent.  I had no idea what I was eating but I loved it! It was also close to the subway so you could go anywhere you wanted in Singapore without having to walk very far.,i find this hotel after we spent 01 night in Grand Hotel of Orchard Road. It has the cheap price. I think their service is suitable to the price. i had my breakfast by myself cooking. Everything has set-up already. After checking-out, the owner was friendly & gave us a souvenirs.",,,,662,93,100
Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,4.5,"4,553 reviews",#46 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,This hotel was recommended by my travel agent. In the past I had only stayed in major chain hotels such as Sheraton and Hyatt so I was a little apprehensive of staying at an unknown brand. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful (what else would you expect in Singapore!), the hotel was very clean, rooms modern and well serviced.   The location was very convenient being only 5 mins walk to the nearest MRT station.  All in all I enjoyed 4 very comfortable nights. I would not hesitate to stay there again in the future. ,A lovely comfortable, clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff. with no pressure of any kind  I’ve never felt so relaxed, comfortable and at home in any hotel before, but not only had I arrived jet lagged, but this was the very first time I’d travelled abroad alone, which makes it doubly OK.  The Rendezvous is set in a superb location, with a bus stop right outside, a food hall opposite  and the metro, including an enormous shopping centre complete with cinemas a short walk away. The Singapore Art Museum is right around the corner. There is a free hotel mini bus to the Suntec Centre at 8.30 am for business travellers, which is otherwise a very cheap taxi ride away as is the blissful shopping area of Orchard Road or you could reasonably walk to either.  The hotel has very, pleasant reception area with a bar around the corner, and entrance to a delightful courtyard with two levels of outlets and area, they were setting up for a bar-be-Que. in the central paved area as I left. It was a pleasant walk through the courtyard, exiting opposite a small park a few minutes walk from the nearest metro station.  The restaurant was set on two levels, and had large windows looking out onto the busy street outside. Staff were cheerful and helpful, although the local dish I’d ordered was unavailable so I had some delicious fruit smoothies instead, although more traditional breakfast was being served too.   My room was delightful, the very best part was the bedside ‘command consul’ which allowed my to adjust the lighting or turn it on/off as well as the TV and air con without having to leap out of my seriously comfortable bed. There was also a setting which prevented me from being disturbed, either by phone, or at the door. Fantastic!  My room overlooked a very pleasant looking pool, and was well furnished. I was especially pleased to find a light in the fitted wardrobe as I nearly always drop something black down the back and struggle to find it. The lighting altogether was very good and well thought out. There were two wall lights fitted into the huge bathroom mirror which miraculously prevented the mirror getting steamed up at head height, as well as giving very good lighting for make up etc. I was really pleased that my travel agent had selected this hotel for me, and consider it to have been good value for money.  I’d like to go to Singapore again and stay at least a week. ,…,We stayed here for 2 nights in March 2005.  The room we had was on the top floor, it was very clean and comfortable overlooking the swimming pool and jacuzzi.  The staff here were very pleasant and helpful and the hotel itself is stunning from inside and out.  It is very near to the MRT which made it ideal for exploring, it is also within walking distance to Suntec City and Raffles. ,We stayed at the Rendezvous in November 05, for a 2 night stop over with 2 kids aged 3 & 4. All the hotels we had booked were 5 star but this one was rated 3/4 so i was dubious about what it would be like but not knowing Singapore we just took our chances. We were really pleased when we arrived, it was very smart, clean and spacious. The beds were very comfy and the rooms had brilliant air con and it was in a fab location. We were a short walk from Dauby Ghaunt CBT (underground). Sentosa Island was one way and Orchard road was the other. It was definatly as good as the 5 star hotels in Oz and Cape Town.,I had 2 nights at the Rendezvous in Singapore while I was there on business. The overall impression of the hotel was very good. The staff were helpful as you’d expect, and room service was quick and courteous. the rooms were nicely done without being too remarkable. The main thing for me was that this hotel seemed to do everything very well and at an extremely keen price – I thought it was really remarkable value for money. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel. Their only omission was staffing at the concierge, they didn’t seem to have any… ","Art Deco Style,Mid-range",,,303,55,100
Cayden Riverfront Residences,4.5,12 reviews,#126 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,We had booked non-refundable accommodation at this hotel for October 2020. Due to COVID-19 we are unable to fly to Singapore as flights from Australia are all cancelled until 2021. I have lost my job due to COVID-19 and we can no longer afford to fly to Singapore or anywhere overseas in the next 2-3 years and all they are offering is to book alternative dates (within next 12 months) which, again, we cannot afford to fly overseas. The other Singapore hotels we had booked around that time were so kind and understanding and gave full refunds despite them also being “non-refundable”.  I realise that it was non-refundable but we did not ""just change our mind"", with Covid-19 in full swing world-wide, this is extremely poor form from a ""reputable establishment that prides itself on, customer service"".  This situation is unprecedented and possessing an understanding and empathetic attitude at this terrible is key to a continued successful business.,…,This is a beautiful property with amazing river view. Very peaceful. Ideally located with shopping mall on the lower floors. The MRT is right below the building. Starbucks, subway and lot of other eating joints around the place.   Ideal place to stay if you want to be in a peaceful environment.   The management is very polite and courteous too.,Cannot fault anything about the premises, the apartment was everything we needed. Perfect location, services were excellent (there's a big pool and Jacuzzi on the property), the room amenities were more than sufficient and the host/manger was really friendly and helpful. The residences are in a shopping complex and across from the night life (though you won't hear a sound). Will definitely be back here,The loft apartment we had for our stay in Singapore was in an excellent location for going out to dinner and drinks - right on Clarke Quay, and the MRT station was right next to the building. Chinatown was within an easy stroll too. The apartment itself was large with plenty of space in the kitchen, lounge and bedroom. Joshua was an excellent host - he was very helpful and accommodating.,It's an unusual setup - some residential apartments  mixed in with offices, in what is primarily an office block but it works wonderfully well. Our apartment  was light, clean, spacious and quiet. The facilities are superb ( gym, pools, sun terrace etc.). The best plus point, however  has to be the location - right over the top of Clarke Quay metro station  - right on the river and an easy walk to dozens of eateries. In addition, a big thank you to the manager (Joshua?) who was extremely  helpful storing  our luggage following  our (very) early arrival. Next  time we're in Singapore  we'll definitely  be back here.",Mid-range,,,565,92,100
Budget Hotel,4.0,29 reviews,#138 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Bicycle rental,,"Share, ,Looking with the name, I never expected too much in this hotel.But i was amazed on what i experienced. The roonm are clean and the hotel staffs are nice. The view is also nice. The beds are clean and cozy.,Situated on Orchad Road, the location is good for shopping around and eat good food. The room was okay, please note that there are no attached bathroom. We had tv but no coffee making machine. But the aminites were ok looking at the price we paid for.,We arrived to check in and received a message saying our reservation has been cancelled. We had to scramble around for accommodations for 5 people (including elderly and a child), and there was zero assistance from Lucky Plaza side.   We have stayed here a few times before and there’s always a bit of a hiccup checking in (difficult to get through for check ins, delayed responses) but this time is definitely the worst. We booked in advance for 7 days from Aug 18-25. When we arrived for check in, I called customer service to say that we were here. They said they’ll check the room, and while I was still on hold I received a message saying our booking has been cancelled. When I asked what happened, they said there was a problem with the aircon with the room the day before, and they, had to cancel the reservation because they had no other rooms to offer us. I asked for other accommodations nearby and they didn’t have any suitable ones, and told me even if there was one I have to pay upfront in cash.   I can understand if there’s a problem with aircons and if that there’s a lack of rooms but the fact that they didn’t even have the decency to call to inform us in advance was terrible. If I hadn’t called them, would they have just taken the money and not inform us? We arrived tired, with full baggages, and were offered no help even though we were there at Lucky Plaza already. Everything was just badly managed. They kept repeating that the money has been refunded but it hasn’t come in so far. I will not be using their accommodations again.,…,ooked this unit (see picture attached) and called to confirm if this will be the actual unit. As i know they have more units in Lucky Plaza apartments. And they confirmed.  Upon arrival- they asked us to wait in Mcdonalds. Ok fine, waited for 30mins when we keep on messaging each other that we are on the way already.   In this humid weather...i started getting frustrated but stayed clam.  Then we went up to the apartment....and it disappointed everyone!  I paid for $1200 for a 3nights stay. With this picture in mind. And i got was....  - living room ac not working very well - bathroom is very old fashioned (not renovated) - dining table/chair - cheap chairs from ikea - kitchen table top are dilapidated - washing machine is loaded with something (checked and there are bathroom, rugs with the bath towels) irk!!!! - unit is secured by a chain lock with a code xxx (they confirmed they change this every guest)   Of course i complained...and showed them the picture i reserved. Guesthouse customer service hotline is not helping at all. When i tried calling them for follow up- they simply hang up my calls!   Aftrr 1 hr of waiting. They came back telling me...  - unit ac is not working (duh, as if this unit is working) - they are offering me a free cancellation!!!!!!!  Free cancellation on the day!!!! Are they kidding me!!!!!   Later on, they offered free airport transfer which we accepted as i might have heart attack if i continue to insist what i deserve for the money we paid for.  I assured my guest if everyone is fine with set up as we want to enjoy the rest of tje day and our vacation.   All said yes. But i vowed to leave reviews for this property!  Watch out for the unit in 13th floor...1324 i think.   Never again!!!!  <too frustrated to take pictures of the unit 😣😣😣>,…,Stayed in 2 of the apartments in Lucky Plaza while in Singapore and both were  nice and clean. Big rooms too.  Mika from Budget Hotel was really helpful. He was just one phone call away when we needed help. He was brilliant.   The apartments more than met our expectations. All the basic things were provided and made our stay really pleasant. The location was really convenient as it is close to shops, restaurants and MRT. We initially stayed in the 18th floor and moved to the 28th floor . The views in the evening on the 28th floor was amazing.

Lai Ming Hotel Cosmoland,2.5,90 reviews,#311 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,The hotel is very old. The rooms are old, toilets are not clean.... there is problem with shower. I had to change towels two times as those are not properly clean. There is no TV in room. There is a monitor which does not always work . No phones to call house keeping, There is no lift so you have to carry your bags if they are heavy. The breakfast is disappointing as they only service bread, butter, jam and tea.... The only plus is the location which is close to MRT. There are various restaurants available close to hotel so you can always find food there. Better for a single backpack traveler. Not recommended for family trip..,This is a filthy hotel. All the facilities are very very old. The toilet are gross, flush not functioning well. Visible dirt and crack tiles all over. Bed are not comfortable and super noisy when you make a move. No amenities, no hair dryer, no slippers, has 2 or 3 local TV channels only. No cabinet to hang your clothes. Nothing at all, just bed and small chair and table.   The towels, OMG, i really cant describe how old they are. Cant imagine using it. Even the blanket are soooo old and thin, good thing we brought our own towels and blanket.,The hotel was near the airport and accessible to the MRT and restaurants.  Staff were English-speaking and  friendly (the old man in the kitchen in the particular).  Overall stay was okey except for the aircon. ,Impressions of the room initially was that it was almost as though they had run out of money or had stopped renovating midway. The TV didn't work in Room 5, the bed was comfortable enough even though the pillows were a little firmer than expected. The lack of power points near the desk (which appeared to be at one stage on the other side of the room where a couch now was positioned) or even the bed itself was a little disappointing, perhaps this had to do with the WiFi coverage that although free occasionally dropped out if the device was basically on the far side of the bed. Showers were OK, took a little time adjusting to the removable head. Upon check out early in the morning I did have to wake up the night desk worker who was snoozing away from the desk. The housekeeper, never went into the room at any stage during the trip, not necessarily a bad thing personally but it meant I had to continue reusing the same towel for a number of days straight.  Location a strong point, basically a 5 minute walk to the MRT and with shops/food outlets within arms reach. The location is, much like the remainder of Singapore, largely safe.,…,This hotel is very affordable especially for a family group of 6 persons. So far the hotel has a best location where it is near to food hawkers, restaurants, convenient stores and MRT. The staff is very polite and friendly to us especially to my baby.  Meanwhile, my concerns that I wanted to share are the following:   1. the room is kinda old and airconditioning is not that good, meaning it is not that cold. 2. Towels provided are very old also and not in good condition anymore.",Budget,,,69,6,78
Lotus at Jervois,4.5,17 reviews,#135 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,We found that lotus at Jervois was a very convenient and comfortable place to stay.  The service provided was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The place is quiet, situated in a nice quiet and leafy area of town.  It’s an easy walk to a number of supermarkets, bars and restaurants or a short taxi ride into town, although a 20 minute walk along the canal-side PCN will take you into the heart of the CBD.  In fact we now live permanently less than half a kilometre away for Lotus as we liked the area so much. I would highly recommend this place to anyone on a short-stay rental or on a generous company package!,I had a two room apartment and it really felt like a home from home.   I couldn't fault the service which was friendly and helpful.  The apartments are located within walking distance to a lovely canal walk, shops, restaurants and public transport.  I would definitely stay at the Lotus again.  Thank you Divine and staff!,Stayed at Lotus on Jervois after reading favourable reviews on tripadvisor.    Could not have been more delighted.   The apartment was 4 bedrooms, perfect for our family consisting of myself, my mother and my two daughters.    It was well maintained, modern, could not fault it.   The receptionist (Divine) and the 24hr security guard were most helpful and willing to accomodate our every need.      Although placed in a quite surburban area, is was still close to shopping centres etc.   Average cost of taxi to Orchard Road was $5SGD.    Nearest shopping centre was Great World City which was a couple of blocks away and had a supermarket for any supplies we needed.  Would definately stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.,Well What can I say? I have been to Singapore on numerous occasions and have always stayed at Lotus at Jervois and will continue to do so. The reason for this is the service is outstanding and the apartments are always well maintained.   It is in a very good (Quiet) location too, Just off River Valley Road and is within walking distance to public transport and Valley Point Shopping Mall.  In comparison to other service apartments in the Central Singapore District it is worthwhile. If you plan to stay in Singapore for Business or Pleasure I do recommend Lotus at Jervois.,Located close to the heart of Singapore, Lotus proved to be an excellant accomodation choice during our recent stay. Our party of 5 adults and 1 child stayed in the 3 bedroom 2 bathroom Garden Terrace Room for 7 nights during our recent holiday. From the moment we enquired online we had terrific assistance from the staff who provided plenty of information and also arranged extras such for a cot for our 1 year old. The 24 hr security ensured that despite the late hour of our arrival we had no problems getting our room.   The apartment was not huge but definitely well laid out and this meant that it felt a lot larger than it actually was. The master bedroom had a nice ensuite with a bath, built in wardrobes, a safe and air conditioning. It was large enough to fit the full size cot, (not a portacot as with most hotels) and the bed was quite comfortable. The other two rooms were similar sized with similar fitting and all with individual split system airconditioning. The main bathroom had a decent sized shower and was well apointed including a hair dryer.  The living and dining room were apointed with a nice timber 6 seater table and leather couch and the TV also had cable included. Both were large enough for our large party and the ajoining terrace area also had an outdoor setting and a beautiful terrace garden making it a great place to relax with a drink. The kitchen had everything you need with cooking appliances, dinner ware, a gas cooktop and an oven. The attached laundry was also cleverly designed to vent the hot air from the dryer out of the apartment preventing it from heating up.  All in all the apartment felt much more like a home than a hotel.  The location of Lotus is very central and a short taxi ride ( $5 SD) to Orchard Road, Clarke Quay and China Town. There is a supermarket and small shopping complex a short walk down the road. For those looking for it there is also a hawker centre a short walk away were you can find delicious street food.  The complex also has a playground and a pool for the kids and we found it to be very child friendly on a whole.  I would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore with a group as it is much cheaper than individual hotel rooms and gives a much nicer place to relax between excursions. Thanks to the reception staff who also helped with a complimentry 2pm checkout on the day we departed.,…",,,,191,11,62

CherryLoft Express,1.0,1 review,#310 of 369 hotels in Singapore,,,"Share, ,complimentary breakfast,air con,Little India,free wifi,Little India,We checked in few days ago. We did not expect much for the price and knew the room would be very small. It was. What we did not expect was the lack of window, the toilet seat full of water (hopefully) splashes/drops and...the yelling neighbors! Every morning and evening you would hear people yelling in the corridor,or in their room,door open or close, and yes, sounds travels terribly. The bed was good and AC working. The lady at the reception is very nice and empathetic but without a clue...we asked where we could do some laundry, she did not know, asked about an iron...1st floor but she wasn't sure..we had to print some paperwork from the computers in front of the reception...did not know either. But that's just a detail. Towels were changed every day but 3 nights with the same, dirty mat, maybe they did not have anymore? After our last couple fight in front of our room we decided to leave. We only did not do it before because it was prepaid and as it is Chinese New year weekend every other hotel last minute cost an arm. If you stay there anyway, you are warned!,…",,,,312,49,100

Fraser Suites Singapore,4.5,557 reviews,#31 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,I stayed at this property in 2019 . Devine experience & comfortable stay like home you get here . Fraser suites provide U room as per requirement , if U have big family then U can request for 2 bedroom . It’s a full furnished with high standards amenities hotel/service apartment.. Every room equipped with kitchenette and bose surround speakers plus washing machine machine and big fridge. You will get 2  bathrooms , one with bath tub . You can enjoy swimming pool - Gym- Sauna-body relaxation chair.,We stayed for more than 2 months. It's an old room with varied disfunctioned items almost every week. The floor had several cracking parts. Some crocoaches also ran around in the bathrooms at nights. There were several wet muddy spots on the ceilings for some aircons leaking, so automatically we had slippery wooden floor everyday. I think the management needs to reconsider the prices being offered. The only strong points that made us decide to stay were friendliness of kitchen staffs who were extraordinary helpful and such good service from housekeepers. The food was good, only needed more variation. Swimming pool was large with such harmonious garden. It's very nice place for relaxing.,We are a family of 3 staying 6 months at Fraser Suits, it is a nice and child friendly serviced apartment. River Valley is a lovely area and people, both guests and staff are super friendly. Location is a plus, nice cafés, grocery shops in the building and a stroller/bike friendly path runs along the Singapore River. Shopping mall Great World is a 5min walk and restaurants at Robertson Quay 15min away walking along the promenade.   Apartment and building is sightly older than many of the other in the area. It is rather noise sensitive (can hear elevator/lounge music from hallway into the kitchen, when people are passing outside and when neighbors are watching TV). Furniture and equipment is worn down, sofa has been repaired several times and there are still holes in it. Had some, issue with equipment breakdown, but this has been solved quickly by Fraser’s.   Breakfast is good, wide variety to suit different international preferences. We prefer Western, not huge amount to chose from but surely OK since they also have to carry alternatives for other guests preference. Staff are amazing, especially with kids!   Biggest minus is the enforces Covid-19 regulations which are above and beyond government recommendations and other apartment complex standards. Gym may only be booked 1hr at a day, perhaps understandable but same goes for the pool. Large pool area and kids love to be there, but with this system it is hard to get a slot and 1hr is not a lot on weekends. Spoke to several other friends in town, seems to be this is something Fraser’s are more or less alone to have during this phase of the pandemic.,…,Stayed here for a month when I relocated to SGP. Great location - Zion hawker market, Great World and even Orchard are 10-15 min away. They also have a shuttle service to Orchard and Robertson Quay. FairPrice and a couple of good restaurants and bakery are right downstairs.   The staff from the reservation team are very understanding to the hassle that we (travellers) go through. Ai Chin helped me with the reservation - I originally booked from the day of my arrival but due to the ATP requirement, I needed to stay in a separate hotel for one night. She helped me convert the first night to another hotel (Capri by Fraser).  All staff there, from the front desk to the household cleaning team, are very friendly and always there to help if you need anything. A shout-out to Raihan who, helped me quite a few times!  It is worth the money.,…,We stayed here for an extended period of time in June and July and our stay was perfect. We stayed here with my 6 year old and dog, and the hotel was very accommodating. They have a shuttle service which runs into town daily which is very convenient. The daily breakfast is perfect and the service at the restaurant was impeccable. Especially Yoges and Raj, their service was above and beyond, always smiling and loving their job. Very professional, very thoughtful and excelling at their work. Also need to mention Karen, who was part of the management team who also went above and beyond to meet our requirements and make our stay as comfortable as possible. Very professional and very caring, which is exactly what you want when you are staying for an extended period of time. Our, cleaner who cleaned our apartment daily was also very thorough and professional. Trustworthy and quick, which is what you want when you are working from home these days. The hotel is close by to the river for a nice walk, and ten minutes walk to Great world city, a shopping centre with a supermarket, pharmacy and eateries. Great location and great stay. Thank you Fraser SUITES!,…","Family,Modern",,,78,5,77
Nnv Hostel,4.0,7 reviews,#147 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Laundry service,,"Share, ,Got to stay for one night in this hostel with my colleagues. The experience was superb. It is within walking distance from the Lavender MRT. Area is more peaceful. Hands down to the front desk in charge that night, he is friendly and attentive towards our requests. For sure will book another night shall we had upcoming trip to SG! ,Stayed here for two nights as it was the best price hostel we could find in Singapore! The staff here are absolutely amazing, the young guy on reception is so friendly and is genuinely interested to chat to you and find out about your travel plans. He drew us up a map and informed us of all the places to visit in Singapore. Our flight was late at night and we were able to leave our bags there all day and even take a shower after we had checked out before we left for the airport.   We stayed in an 8 bed mixed dorm, my bed was super uncomfortable and I could feel the springs, however my boyfriends was really comfy and soft, so it’s just luck I guess! There is a bit of a funky smell inside the dorms, (all I can describe it as is peppery) but we luckily had some air freshener so it, wasn’t a problem. The air con works well and there was 2 air con units in our room so it was nice and cold. I didn’t sleep well at this hostel however this was not due to the hostel, but due to the idiot roommates we were lumbered with. One guy was making a phone call at 4am and another had set an alarm for every 15 minutes starting at 3am, despite the fact he didn’t wake to any of them! Obviously this is no fault of the hostel, just people being inconsiderate!   There is a 7/11, fresh price, food court and MRT a 2 minute walk away which was super handy!  The staff definitely made our experience at this hostel! ,…,The gents that run NNV do a really great job in their approach to customers, and are friendly and welcoming to one and all. I was extremely impressed by their friendly nature.   I left my beloved shirt there and e-mails to say I would pick it up in a couple of months. The communication was superb, and they had the item ready when I finally returned. The duty of care that they demonstrated really impressed.   There is a rooftop area, and some kitchens. I think the boys still need to do some work on some of the odours, but essentially it is a central, great value, friendly little place to be based in Singapore for a short stay.   Thank you SO much NNV.,Nice and clean hostel on Lavender street, 4 minutes walk from Lavender MRT. The best thing about NNV are Charles and Victor in the reception. They make you feel at home right away and are super helpful!  Good AC in the dorms and free laundry machines are amazing. Only negative thing was a weird smell in my dorm.  Oh and a nice secret is the rooftop which was perfect to have brekkie on or a drink in the evening!,We stayed, as a family of 4, in the 6-bed bunk room. It was absolutely fine, pretty basic but you don't come to Singapore to sit around your hotel room. It's got air con, you have access to the communal fridge, toaster, microwave & washing machine.  The 2 guys that run the hostel are fantastic. Really interesting to chat to & full of information & suggestions about what to do, how to get where & onward travel plans etc.  Location is good...2 minutes a 7-11 & mini mart, 5 mins to the lavender MRT, even the bay front is walkable (about 2.5km).  If you're travelling on a budget, this place is ideal.",,,,145,13,90

The owner of the hostel so much friendly and he know how to take good care of his guests. And even the receptionist or representative on the desk so friendly. Hoping i could come back again after this FUNDEMIC.  5 STARS FOR THIS HOSTEL. thank you and god bless.,+ I stay there with my wife, also with our children 1 todler 3 yo and infant 1,5 yo, The service and the staff very helpfull and nice, i was check in very late because of my flight delay, i was confirm with the staff by phone and they realy fast respond, and wait me for check in. The standard double room is extra ordinary for a hostel, and they very good and profesional. The breakfast is okay bread and jam, also have a cereal, milk coffe and tea. I'am very satisfied with the service. Staff Very helpful and amazing, definetly i will be back there again when i visit singapore. And i'm very recommend to another traveler stay in this hostel. The price also reasonable for the standart double room.  - Nothing, everything is so perfect and amazing.,We shared one bed. And rooms and washrooms are so clean. Safe place. Near to all the tourist places. Breakfast was so good. Small but cozy place. Love it. It's near main road. So easy to take bus or MRT. Had good time. Reception also kind and helpful. ,Dear Travellers,  If your purpose solely is to explore the city and come back to sleep & have breakfast, then this place is for you. The room is not that spacious and lockers are not large enough to keep your trolley bags, you may just be able to fit your average sized shoulder bag. However, you may lock your trolley bag and keep it adjacent to your bed side.  The dinning area is quite like a narrow lane and there is no facility to drink cold water. The hostel would provide a breakfast with cereals suck cornflakes, chocos, milk, coffee, bread butter, jam. A 20$ would be a refundable deposit which would be returned to you on the last day.  Hence, if you are looking a family stay, do prefer a hotel instead and not a hostel since girls & boys would stay in a same room.  Moreover,, you may check-in anytime in night or day as it is totally flexible. The location is very good as it is situated just 1 KM from Little India which has lot of restaurants and 550 meters from Farrer Park MRT station.,…,So I'm newly single and healing. I needed to get away. I found this hotel as I'm on a tight budget. The hotel is not 24 hours check in but if you arrive late at night you can call  / contact the hotel in advance about it. Upon arrival at 2am, the lobby is empty but there was a prepared room card / key, towel and beddings under my name. Its a hotel rule to return the beddings back upon check out.  When I entered the room, there was a girl sleeping on the bed assigned to me. I had the right to complain about it but since I was sick, tired and no staff at the reception, I just picked the other empty bunk bed.There was a locker inside the room assigned to guests but some of the lockers had broken doors. As a precaution, I take all my important stuff with me for safety reasons. The, bed space has curtains, a lamp and plug for charging. They have free light breakfast on the shared kitchen and they also have a shared bathroom. Smoking is not allowed inside the hotel but you can smoke on the table infront of the hotel.  The hostel is walking distance to the train station, malls and restaurants. It is great to stay here if you are on a tight budget while in Singapore and it helped me save a lot while roaming. I might return if ever I come back to Singapore.,…",Budget,,,84,14,83
5footway.inn Project Ann Siang,3.5,235 reviews,#84 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,I noticed some of the reviews about taking over-charging and taking money twice...but I didn't pay attention, and now it has happened to me!  Please don't book this hotel..they have terrible customer service and you will end up disputing charges instead of enjoying your vacation!! it's so not worth it..there are plenty of great hotels here and businesses like this one ruin vacations and make Singapore look bad...just such a shame, save yourself the headache and pay the extra $10 to stay in a 3 star hotel...and far away from this one :),We paid first in cash when we got there, to then discover when we left that they took money from our card as well.  The reception was almost never occupied and bathrooms were not very nice. Breakfast was a disappointment, you only got white bread, jam and coffee, that’s all... The bedrooms were fine. ,Pros: - The location is great. It takes just 5 minutes to go to China town, MRT, Buddha Tooth pagoda and 7eleven is opposite. - The hotel is bright and clean. - Room is bigger than we imaged. Cons: - The hotel is in 3rd floor and no elevator. - They always clean the bathroom early in the morning when we need to take shower before going out. - Sometimes, the toilet is not really clean.,The hotel was pretty easy to find as it was situated in a very central location in Chinatown, right across the road from Chinatown's walking street and food street. However, do be aware that in order to get to the reception area, you will need to climb through 3 flights of stairs. And if you are staying on the 4th floor, you will also need to do another round of stair climbing. As our family consisted of 3 members, we stayed in a triple room, and which the third ""loft"" bed can be reached by climbing a precarious two meters steel ladder in the room. I would like to warn those who move a lot in their sleep not to sleep in this ""loft"" bed as the height of the mattress is about the same level as the barrier, and you may run the risk of falling to the floor below. The ensuite, bathroom is moldy in some corners and the toilet seat is practically right beside the showerhead. Overall, the room is quite very minimal with just a doubles bed, a table and a chair. Wifi is fast. Breakfast is just bread, butter, jam, and instant coffee. They also have a rooftop common area (4th floor) where you can get hot/cold drinking water and a good view of Chinatown. If you think that you will be in Singapore for just a night or two and will not be staying in the hotel much, this might be the hotel for you.,…,Best location to explore local foodie spots and attractions. Maxwell hawker centre 2 min walk, 5-10 min walk to people’s park centre, chinapoint shopping centre, Hong lim. Bus stop downstairs and MRT 5 min walk.   3 stars for ammenities, cleanliness... stayed in deluxe triple loft with private shower. Clean towels and basic body wash provided. Beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. Got back issues, best stay away. Air con worked perfectly. Don’t leave any food out or bugs will mob you! Daily breakfast was white toast, jam and instant oats. Good if you’re in a pinch and  want to save $.    Loved the view from rooftop Terrance! Warning be prepared to climb 3 flights stairs for general entry plus 1 more for Terrance.

Laguna National Golf and Country Club,3.5,26 reviews,#245 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,This was my second trip to Laguna National and I have played golf throughout the world.  Last year, the course was in ok shape and the customer service was average so we decided to come back again this year when business brought us to Singapore.  We were supposed to tee off at 9 am on the Masters Course.  They sent us to the 10th tee which had three foursomes ahead of us.  They then sent us to the 1st tee.  We played our first seven holes without incident, but the greens were brown and bumpy.  There was a 1 hour rain delay after that and we had lunch at the restaurant.  We then finished hole 8 and 9, which was a temporary par 3 as well as 18 which was also a temporary par 3; we were not told about the construction when we booked our tee time and for $280 dollars, I would like to, know if I'm playing a Par 70 vice a Par 72.  We arrived at the 10th tee to find three foursomes lined up and then we were told that because of the rain delay, the course was backed up and we could not play the back 9.  We had planned our whole day around this round and now got bumped off the course after playing the full rack rate.  We went to the front desk and asked for a refund as we were unable to play the entire round which we had paid for.  The customer service person said she needed to ask the GM and he came to speak to us.  He immediately was rude and abrasive and told us we were lucky to play their private course.  He told us that the best he could do was charge us for 9 holes, which is more than half of the 280 we paid, and that we could receive a refund of $120.  He was extremely rude and inconsiderate especially as this is really a semi-private course open to anyone willing to shell out $280 dollars.  We took our $120 ""refund"" and left vowing to never return.  I recommend you play Marina Bay Sands which is in far better shape and half the price and none of the attitude.  Marina Bay also has a driving range, which Laguna currently does not as they are building a hotel, but that has been under construction for over a year.  I've paid more to play golf, but this was the worst value I have ever received and the worst customer service I have ever received.  There are many nice courses in Singapore so I strongly recommend you play elsewhere.,…,With 3 swimming pools, great food and excellent quality, this definitely will be the perfect place for all to enjoy or relax. If you do not have anything to do in the suites, then go down to the swimming pools to either relax, have fun, or swim.The suite that I went to had a flight of stairs (awesome!) and I was overjoyed,however some suites do not have stairs.The suite is very clean and is up to my expectations .I definitely enjoyed my time there and I am sure you will too!,Pretty hard to believe your shoes will not be there once back from the course, especially from a club like Laguna...but it happened....and all the staff do not care...extreme bad service and not even a proper feedback...Beautiful course but tough though,I would say that Laguna exists for the golf first, and accommodation second. The golf course is very good (Masters) and well worth a visit if you are coming through Singapore. The accommodation is not 5 star, but if you wanted that you would stay in the city centre. The rooms are quite large and have a separate lounge area, but are a little dated. It is probably equivalent to a 3 to 4 star hotel. The location can be a problem if you're a light sleeper as it's on the final approach to the airport with some very early morning flights. Staff are excellent and the open bistro/ bar area very nice after a hard day on the golf course. Worth a visit but don't expect it to be like a Hyatt hotel.,I have been a member of the Laguna Golf & Country Club for some years now and have enjoyed many a great day out, good and bad golf as is to be expected from a week-end golfer. Unfortunately the owners have made some serious mistakes in running the club, the World Classic Golf Course is pretty much a disaster that needs re-designing, reminiscent of the latest landscape pictures the Mars Rover sent ""home"". The member drive to extend the lease for the owner and members so amateurishly done that the word misleading opportunism doesn't cover it. The Food & Beverage operation is a disgrace to the trade and members alike. Inconsistant at best. Ah, the redeeming factor...so many nice employees that seem to hold it all together! If I wouldn't have been a golfer but lets say...a shopper,, this mall would have gone bust a long time ago!,…",,,,15,1,43
Raffles Town Club,4.0,33 reviews,#250 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,I had a good sleep on the first night on the straits suite. However on the 2nd night when I change to the spa suite, the motor for the spa pool could not be turn off and it was so noisy that me and wife cannot sleep until 4am !   Around 2am, the motor was so noisy I had to walk around the whole club trying to find someone to help but to no Available.  End up I had to walk to the security at the external gate before they direct me to the back of the club to find the duty manager.  After that, duty manager attended to my case immediately but it was resolved only 45 minutes later ! So we only sleep close to 3 30am.  Do note that before this, I had tried to call the room reservation and security number and nobody answer !!  Nobody in the club inform us or brief us about turning over, the motor at night so the noise will be gone.  For anyone else planning to stay there, please do take note of the loud noise from the Motor especially from the spa room ! Maybe sure you do know how to turn it off at night.  Room quality was slight run-down but still relatively clean.  Oh ya, I did request for a complimentary night so the rather awful sleep which I had but it was turn-down. But they did offer a free room upgrade for my next stay,…,Went to the Cafe & Terrace Restaurant for lunch today. The mee goreng was flat and tasteless, distinctly lacking the wok hey flavour it used to have. In addition, all 6 pieces of chicken wings were bloody. The standard has really gone down. Avoid.,Have been patronizing this place for quick bites but over the years changes occurred, at times food are good and prices reasonable. Can't really rate this place as not good but the only dish that didn't fail is the nasi goreng that comes with different condiments and still reasonably priced.,I stayed for four nights at Raffles Town Club. The stay was very comfortable. The location is excellent and amenities very good.  Staff were courteous and helpful. However, not many food options for a vegetarian.,We had a delicious lunch at the cafe. The special for the day was the fish head curry for 2 people but we could share for 3 people as it was a big portion. We also had the hokkein mee which was only ok.

I cannot say enough good things about the management, even though we had a very cheap booking rate.   Rooms - small (like Hong Kong hotels) but fully functional around a good design. Deluxe room with corner view was charming and still fairly quiet; street noise was muted.   Basic room was very basic and tiny. It was fully internal with no windows or ventilation except a toilet fan. (Shower had a sky light for daylight hours.) The toilet door was stuck open but the concierge was ready to have it fixed immediately we informed him. Unlike the deluxe room there was very limited space to open a suitcase.   In both rooms, the air conditioner could be left, running while we were out. Quite important in the wet season!  In summary, tiny rooms, no natural light on the basic room, but charming deluxe rooms and outstandingly good management. ,…,The host connected well and made all arrangements. We were traveling as afamily with a small child. the pantry area is shared. the only plus was very neat and clean. the sheets were changed everyday. some good bars and restaurants are just below the property. its far from everything. my taxi bill was more than the money i paid for staying here!!! choose this if you dont find accommodation anywhere. ps: price included breakfast, but its next to nothing.,Fine for one night and was close to airport and ferry terminal that we needed.  Room very small and bathroom minute.  Almost difficult to open shower door wide enough to get in and we are not huge people.  Bathroom could have been cleaner.

They offer rooms with baths, so I requested one as I've had back issues. It has a bath (of sorts), but the whole hotel doesn't have a single bath plug. To get genuinely hot water for showers (rather than tepid) you have to play around with the tap and set it so that you reduce the flow of water. Your hotel is surrounded by what I think are brothels. And then, the icing on the cake, the fire alarm goes off about 7 times before 8am on a Saturday morning!!!!!

There is however, locker near the bed to store bags.   $18 per person.",,,,317,24,100

SkyOrchids,2.5,14 reviews,#294 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,One of the cheapest hostels in Singapore. We've spent 13 SGD/night for a bed in common room. Breakfast (toasts, jam, tea, coffee, milk, cereals), good massage chair,  few good shower rooms. Everythng's clean and staff was polite. Situation is pretty good too (5 minutes away from monorail station and few cheap food stalls near).,First step is to find the hostel, not easy because it's absolutely not written on the door. Keep in mind: the number is 98S don't hesitate to enter, it's on the first floor. Every body has to leave his shoes when entering the flat but it doesn't mean that it is particularly clean. Room is ok, there are quality bunk beds with air conditionning. Living-room is correct but it's forbidden to eat and there is no table in the kitchen, I'm still looking for a place to eat! Maybe you will need to go to the bathroom? There are three places: a shower very correct but there is no light. Fortunately the light of the street helps you to find your soap. The second one is a toilet-shower without toilet seat. In the third place, is that 1 cm dew layer on the toilet seat? Don't forget your, cleaner to sit or use a lot of paper! If there is paper...,…,I tried e mailing and ringing the hostel, and there was no response. On arriving in Singapore I could not find it, even though searching on google confirmed I was in the right area. I gave up and had to find other hotel. I guess I'll be charged as I was unable to confirm a cancellation beforehand. The hostel site said to contact the hostel, but I was unable to. Not happy!,I was quite surprised with this Hostel, first it was quite difficult to find as it isn't really signposted. It's right at the end beside a shop through a non-assuming door. However it is located right beside the MRT station which made transport a dream. The room we stayed in was a 4 bed dorm with AC without windows meaning when lights out it's PITCH black., due to its close proximity to the station this turned out to be beneficial as we had quiet sleep filled nights. The WIFI was good and the upstairs communal area had a massage chair (nice touch). The hostel provided breakfast: Coffee or Milo and Toast with Jam and butter, there is always a queue for the Toaster so either get down early or be prepared for a bit of a wait. The management didn't provide any information about what, to do in Singapore besides a map. The bathrooms were clean, the showers seemed quite temperamental and the toilets could've done with restocking of toilet roll more. Would happily stay here again!!,…,Have stayed in this Hostel numerous times . Yes the previous lady in charge could be difficult ,but I did not have any problems with her ,apart from forgetting to take my shoes of .This lady has moved on . The young lady in charge now is very helpful . The hostel is clean and tidy ,beds are very comfortable . There is a basic breakfast of toast ,cereal , coffee . My last visit was Feb 2013 . I consider the hostel good value for what you pay and will be using it again .",,,,61,5,77

Beat. Sports Hostel,2.0,2 reviews,#246 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,free wifi was included,Little India,air conditioner,great air conditioning,The hostel looks new and clean. It is near restaurants and shopping malls. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is OK. Locker is spacious. Slippers are provided for everyone. Towels are for rent. Wifi does not work inside the bedroom. The male toilet is located only on the 2nd floor so be ready to walk. The bed room is really warm, had a difficulty sleeping because of the warm termperature. They need to have their airconditioning unit fixed. No elevator, had to carry my luggage to the 3rd floor. The upper bunk capsule bed is dangerously high and is difficult to reach. With its price, you could find something better in Singapore.,The pro: The common room is decent and bright and free-wifi internet is working well (only here). The hostel is surrounded by cheap eating places, cheap 24 hours neighbourhood mini market and next to a major bus stop.   The cons: The free wifi doesnt work outside the common room. We are asked to store our shoes at the second level and changed to the slippers, but the slippers were not available for everyone and the surface of the floors itself were very dirty. So it is not recommended to walk bare feet and then the shoes' shelf was dirty too. The family room was very small, with only 1 meter width alley to walk between beds and bathroom. The bunk beds were not safely and securely design, there were stairs to climb up but there were no railings on the upper beds where you can, hold on to when climbing the stairs up. So we had to hold on the moving/unstable mattresses. It was like a life-threatening experience each time we had to climb and down. The staff did nothing to make our stay more comfortable or giving the best customer experience. The breakfast just minimal, and on the one of the day the butter/margarine was finished, I asked for more and the staff were simply said ""no more"" without saying any sorry nor try their best to get it more. It seems that they were paid very minimal and they didnt strive to serve better to their customers/guests. The common room area looks tidy and clean, but once you walk around the other areas/ common bathroom areas/ alleys, they totally look the opposite. The staff could have done more to make all guests' stay comfortable. Overall, the hostel is considered okay/acceptable for a developing country's standard but certainly not for an international standard nor for a Singapore standard. I regret to have booked this hostel.,…",,,,328,27,95

My room was large and not expensive at all. They had a decent South Asian restaurant that had some good dishes from Pakistan and India.

Overall I would not mind staying here again. ,I was told that Cockpit hotel has a long history in Singapore. The staffs here are very professional with smiles and ready to help anytime.

Glamping City,2.0,7 reviews,#272 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,This was for a childs birthday celebration. The pre-ordered picnic had not been organized by the vendor so there was no food. The tent was basic with a massive patch of mud at the entrance making it quite uncomfortable. Many things meant to be provided were not given until asking multiple times. Staff exceptionally slow to respond (unless they collecting money). Ordered the balloons decoration, massive disappointment for price.,I was a bit conservative on my expectations when I read multiple horrible reviews. But to be honest, it was a fantastic experience. We had a neat and clean tent which had a great look and was right on the beach. There were multiple tenets around and bbq pits which were occupied till late. Didn’t bother us at all and we weren’t looking for complete solitude either. The kids had fun and we had a great time!!! There aren’t any shops or restaurants within walking distance. This is good as it ensures fewer people in the area. Plus we had a car so there were no issues getting food or any other thing if needed.  PS: the toilets aren’t bad either....,All dissapointments in your service that you should be aware of while offering these luxury services to customers, or before you raise expectations too high.  1. Camp location was s big turn off. Your FAQs mention that the tent will be away from bbq pits to maintain privacy...yet it was next to 15 other tents and all bbq pits behind occupied. Constant disturbance with people partying till 4am (in and outside the camps) in the morning, and no privacy whatsoever.  2. Lighting inside the tent - It was so not like advertised in the photographs at all. Lighting was extremely dim, we could barely see stuff inside, let alone take some nice photos. Okay this would still be okay, but I paid extra for a romantic picnic for two, and half of the lanterns, teelights on the dining table were, not working. We had to shift our dining setup outside the tent to eat.  3. Quality of dining setup. I'm not sure if it was a private setup or someone elses in the advertisement, but the photographs on your website advertised proper cutlery and wineglasses, and not cheap plastic sets that we had.  4. The romantic picnic for 2 set included fairylight pathway, fresh flower bouquet as advertised, yet none of the above was there. This ruined it completely. Why do you expect me to pay the full amount for the picnic when 2 noticeable items are missing from the list, dining lights not working, cheap cutlery etc. I was extremely disappointed with this.  All in all, our moment was ruined, I had to plan another getaway elsewhere to recover. We were quite dissapointed and hope you guys can make $400 worth for anyone in future by improving the quality of your luxury service if you are contonuing to offer.  Thank you. Sanchar,…,Booked an overnight family tent for up to 4 people. For the price and based on what was advertised, we were expecting an actual service with a check-in process. Upon arrival, in the thick of rain, and unexperienced staff member simply brought us to the tent and left us there. No instructions provided on where the bathrooms are, what to do in case of emergencies, etc.  Also, the website advertised that there would be two USB ports for charging devices in addition to fairy lights. It turned out that no USB ports were provided and the fairy lights were so weak they almost looked dead. The actual setup looked quite plain and underwhelming compared to images online. An ice box was provided, and you would expect that at least a bottle of water would be included there, given the price., But nope.  We tried to contact Glamping City to ask about the promised USB ports and procedure in the event of a thunderstorm. I called both hotlines provided over email and tried to get in touch with the staff who ""checked us in"", but no one was picking up. This actually raises some safety concerns, and it gives the impression that Glamping City doesn't actually have any service staff on standby.  Some positive notes: the tent was sturdy enough to prevent water entry, and the inflatable beds were sufficiently sized.  In short, this was more of a camping experience than a ""glamping"" experience. Many of the amenities provided could be sourced out on your own at a much lower cost, with just a little bit of prep time. The public washrooms were also quite far from the campsite and quite dirty, so be prepared.,…,We booked 2 family tents. Tents were set-up next to our booked bbq pit which was nice. Although we said we would be here for 4pm, the team didn't show up till 5 pm. We were supposed to have padlock for both tents but only had it for one. The team came and installed the fans and gave us extra battery which came to be handy. When they asked about our camping permit, we reminded them that they collected it the week before - someone came later to bring it back.  The tent was nice, clean and cosy. But what totally blew off the experience were the deflated beds. All 4 beds were merely inflated. Kids could sleep fine but for adults we had a terrible night sleeping on the hard floor! For $246 per night it is clearly overpriced and unacceptable. When we flagged it upon check out we had a, disinterested sorry. Although the ""glamour"" is supposed to justify the price, they should bear in mind that for barely $150 more you have a  room in a luxury hotel. Save your money and investigate on further options.,…",,,,,,

iBackpacker Lavender,2.0,5 reviews,#249 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,free wifi was included,Little India,air conditioner,great air conditioning,The bathroom for ladies has no hangers for clothes.  There was no place to put my shower gel and shampoo.  The water kept leaking so the floor is always wet.  It was dirty and disgusting.  I cannot image it is in Singapore.  It is worse than some venues in developing countries.  Some toilets don't even have a sitting ring!  ,kami menginap disini hanya berdua , saat check-in kami di beri kamar yang berisi 4 kasur seharga 60SGD , padahal tertera di kartu seharga 50SGD memang kesalahan kami tidak membooking hostel dahulu , disini tidak ada breakfast , dan kami hanya menginap 1 malam lalu pindah ke hostel lain keesokan harinya,We booked this backpackers in Singapore based on the price and the fact that we were only in Singapore for 12 hours on a layover. We did have the option to stay at the Airport, however we wanted to be able to have a few beers and from previous lay overs at the airport the drink prices are ridiculous. We made a booking iBackpackers through a website, when we arrived the backpackers is on a quiet street but we had trouble finding the entrance , you have to go around the rear of the building and take the elevator to another floor. Upon arrival the staff member was attentive and knew which booking was ours, probably as we were the only non-Asian guest that had a booking + we arrived late at night so I suspect we were the last booking of the day to arrive. We were given the list of, rules, pretty standard hostel stuff and our room keys. IBackpackers is a modest building I am assuming that it is an old office block, the reception has ample seating for socialising and an internet kiosk and there appeared to be many people staying here, from other asian countries who appear to be working in Singapore. The Decor of the hostel is very Shabby but when you equate the bed price of $13 AUD what do expect. We went to our room a 4 bed dorm, there were 4 travelling together and we all got to go into the same room which is a bonus, it was small, but had airconditioning a TV and lockers, the room seemed comfortable enough for the 4 of us and to be honest we weren’t expecting the Hilton anyway. All we needed was a place to store our bags, freshen up and have a nap before our next flight. The receptionist pointed us in the direction of a Local bizarre, which served amazing food at reasonable prices, by this stage it was 11pm and this place still had plenty of local people there, beers were cheap $18 singapore dollars for 3 large Tigers and a sprite. We returned to the hostel well after midnight and used the facilities to get ready for bed, the bathroom sinks were dirty and there were scraps of vegetables and fish bones in the sink, now the reason for this is we later found the kitchen which is 2 meters long and 1 meter wide, it is basic and there did not appear to be a sink to wash up so obviously everyone washes their dished in the bathroom sinks. We left the hostel very early in the morning, and as we had disliked the bathroom sinks we decided not to venture into the showers. In summary if you are on a budget, this place is ok for a night or two, the,…,This place was one of the cheapest I found online so I decided to give it a go. If saving a few dollars is your thing, and you don't care about the conditions of your accommodation,  this might be for you.  Just to get to the hostel (3rd floor) you have to take the slowest ricketiest old elevator, and pass the abandoned second floor. Don't accidentally stop there late at night it will freak you out. The hostel itself is pretty grubby, while the staff aren't unpleasant, you definitely need to do your own thing. At least the wi-fi seemed decent.  Most other guests seemed reluctant to have a conversation or even look me in the eye, not a friendly hostel. Rooms not greatly comfortable and the location, about 10 minutes from Lavender MRT, is not that convenient with other hostels, closer to the station. Probably would be best to just spend the few extra dollars on somewhere a bit less grubby.,…,Ok if you are a single male and don't mind the smell of cigarettes and grime everywhere. Don't get off on the 2nd floor.  Don't take your daughters as there is sleazy men roaming the corridors. Nice food court over the road. In between 2 MRT lines.",,,,226,19,92

Parc Sovereign Hotel - Tyrwhitt,3.5,"1,212 reviews",#180 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Korean","Share, ,New hotels always have hiccups don't they?Well,this hotel proves that it's no exception.I booked a staycation as a surprise for my fiancée & requested particularly for the deluxe resort's with the pink cushions..But guess what?We got those with the blue & green ones.Such a simple request yet they couldn't cater to it.I've gone too many hotels who go the extra mile but if you expect anything like that,this hotel is not the one.The rooms are small,somewhat like Hotel 81.And beware,they have an $80 cleaning fee should u leave the room below their expectations.Shouldn't cleaning be the job of housekeeping & not guests?Why are we paying to make sure the place is clean?Definitely won't return.,Just arrived 930am. I was immediately approached by the front desk manager (i guess?). I was expecting to leave my luggage and come back at check in time. But to my surprise he given me a room immediately. It seems that he knew I arrived from a sleepless long flight. I am working in a luxury 5* hotel and that hospitality he showed is indeed comparable to 5* then next is the lady who gave us a very detailed walk through of the hotel facilities. Then before going to the room the same guy came back to me and handed over a complimentary breakfast voucher which I really didn't expect at all.  The hotel is new, clean and comfortable. I can't see any flaws!,I generally don't comment on here unless something is either superb or terrible, but issues need addressing at this hostel...sorry hotel We arrived at the hotel via the Mrt station, only a 10min walk,  so position wise we found it pretty good. From the Mrt you can access all of Singapore within 20mins. Check in was a complete disaster, there were no seats in reception as it was that busy so we were advised to take a seat in the bar where we got a drink and waited to be checked it (For approx 30min) Drinks were £12 for a beer and lemonade!!!! (Come on that's the same price as in marina bay sands!!) We were then told our double room with large balcony was unavailable and they only had a twin room with small balcony available at the time, and would swap us to a double room the day, later. A bit of a pain as we couldn't unpack. Not to worry though we thought. When we came to pay we were still being charged for the larger room we had booked and no reductions for the mistake. So theoretically we had just been DOWNGRADED!!! Never in my life has a hotel messed my booking up and downgraded us for the same cost!!!! We went to the room and in all honestly it smelt off urine and the lights were making a loud buzzing sound,  so we had to complain and amazingly they managed to find us the correct room we had booked?!?! Straight away the alarm bells were ringing that something was going on here.  Checked into the new room and everything was ok, just ok. Walls quite grubby, not the cleanest toilet area and the corridors to the rooms are some what like a hostel, dark and dingy.  Rooms are very small, occupied by a stupidly large seat which is far too big for the room, no where to put your clothes so you'll live out of your suitcase whilst your there, shower cubicle is microscopic!! At night the sound from little india is unbearable, you will struggle to sleep until 2am ish. The soundproofing of the rooms is terrible, waking up every morning to what sounded like people jogging down the corridor.  Also it seems no taxi drivers know we're the hotel is and you find yourself just going to lavender Mrt station! After 3 nights here I was genuinely glad to be leaving, this is quite possibly the 2nd worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and for £300, a complete shambles. All in all this hotel is terrible value for money, and I would not return here if they offered me 5 nights free on our next return to Singapore. Be warned...stay away ,…,This hotel is the second Parc Sovereign in Singapore and it opened on 6th June. We booked for 4 nights from 20th to 24th June. Everything was well set up, the rooms are well furnished and more importantly spacious by Singapore standards in this budget. We were upgraded to the executive / deluxe room just like everyone else in this offer period. The staff were friendly and helpful.  Things I liked:  1. Walking distance (5-7 mins) to Lavendar MRT on the EW line. Bus stops close by (2 mins) for almost anywhere in the city. 2. Multiple kinds of international plug sockets, including USB sockets for charging your devices 3. Speedy wi-fi compared to other hotels I have stayed in. 4. Android TV box to connect to the internet via the 42' TV. Also had a keyboard and mouse. 5. They have, spare irons and ironing boards that you can use. 6. They let us check in a couple hours early and check out a few hours late.  Things to watch out for: 1. Restaurant not open yet. Might open in July. 2. No closet for keeping your clothes. There were several hangers and hooks though.,…,Wanted a simple, pretty and affordable place for a staycay and decided to come to Parc Sovereign Tyrwhitt early December 2015 .   Hotel Experience   Very simple and elegant for a boutique hotel. Quite like their cosy feel, but some may feel it's a bit small. The rooms are cosy, but yes definitely rather small, although still comfortable for 3 girls. We wanted a room with garden access but that costed us SGD 60 more. Wasn't worth it only because we only booked for one night and for the first day it was raining and the grass was rather muddy. Only got a chill for a short time in th pretty garden before we checked out. If you're staying for a longer period of time, a garden access room is really pretty and a good experience if you like that sort of thing! Looks wonderful in photos, too actually!   There are basically two types of gardens, one with the nice swing and the other with just two garden seats and a small coffee table. I don't know if you can choose, I didn't get the choice and ended up with the latter instead of the swing. Don't worry if you ended up like me because there are swings in the pool area too!   The toilet is considered small, but still quite nice. Bathroom area is connected to the toilet seat. 3 persons can fit into the entire area, so it isn't that bad. The sink is on the outside, however.   I LOVE the TV. It's a smart TV and they've provided a keyboard and mouse for easier access. You can surf YouTube Facebook and the web browser right from the TV itself it is connected to the wifi. But I've observed that it is a tad laggy...   Fortunately for me, I could connect my own MacBook with the HDMI cable as well. So that was not bad! I was quite happy with the TV! Rather impressive considering the fact that the other hotels I've been to didn't have such a good TV connection or wifi connection. The wifi strength is rather good. Had no major issues with it.   Bed is quite okay, but there isn't any wardrobe, which is strange. No surprise since the room is quite small. You'll have to hang your clothes outside there are only about 3-4 hangers. There is a working table right in front of the TV and another sofa chair beside the bed.   Gym is quite small with only 3-5 equipment. Gym and pool are on the top floor. The pool is rather impressive by a small boutique hotel's standards. By far the best lap pool I've been to compared to other boutique hotels. I could comfortable swim 20 laps. But I'm not sure if it's 50m per lap. But it's only about 0.8 or 1m deep.   Service  When I was checking in, there were quite a number of people. So it was a little chaotic. But it took only about 10 mins. Hotel staff are generally nice and friendly.   Tip: try to go before the stipulated check in time to avoid a crowd.  Location  It isn't exactly very convenient in a sense that it takes a 5-10 mins walk to the nearest bus stops and the MRT is possibly a good 15-20 mins walk if not more. You'll probably have to take a bus of about a few stops to the MRT. However, if you are coming by taxi or a car, it should be no issue except you'll have to be VERY CLEAR about the hotel address and specify to the cabbies that you are going to the TYRWHITT branch instead of the other because my two friends had two cabbies who STILL took them to the wrong branch despite reminders. Just be aware. Let the cabbies know that it is the one near Jalan Besar or the Jalan Besar stadium. I took an Uber so it was no issue since I keyed in the postal code.   Food places  Hotel is located rather strategically, close to nice cafes and small eateries even with cheap coffee shop local food places. The famous Chye Seng Huat cafe is just a good 2 mins walk away from the hotel. I heard coffee is awesome but I am not a coffee lover. Haha they have pasties that are not bad too! Alternatively, you could take a bus to Lavender for more food choices.  Overall If you are looking for a reasonable, inexpensive and quiet hotel for a short stay and wouldn't mind the less than ideal location if you're not planning to travel too much, this is a good hotel to consider. It is still close enough to main shopping places and is considered not too inaccessible.,…",Modern,,,229,24,91

Ambassador Hotel,2.0,19 reviews,#316 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Family rooms,,"Share, ,Would NOT recommend this hotel.  Booked a family room for 140 SGD (Can't believe they would price their rooms as such).  Luckily we had not paid as when we got to the room it was without functioning air conditioning (90F), it was dark despite lighting, it had no windows, exposed electrical wiring/cords were noted taped to the walls and it had a very dirty looking bathroom.  The front desk staff were very unhelpful and appeared surprised that we may point out these deficits.  We were able to walk around the corner to the Parklane hotel which for 40 more SGD were able to find us a room on a Saturday night.  Little India itself is a fantastic place.....Post Ambassador hotel all was well.,This hotel is a complete rip off.  Next morning when you ask them for breakfast they send you to one of their another hotel nearby. There is nothing I can say is good about Ambassador. The rooms are so small that you may hit yourself somewhere and also the toilets are so small that its very hard to sit on the toilet seat and while in the shower you cannot bend to apply soap on your legs as its that small. Please think twice before booking this hotel. I had never expected a hotel like this in Singapore. It should be reported to the Tourism and other authorities there.,The hotel is centrally located and good for Indian food and shopping. However, there is very poor management and rude staff in the front made my stay very bad. The air conditioner was not functioning till my stay and no one was interested to repair it. I have hesitation to recommend anyone to stay in such a condition. The hotel required very many things to improve in terms of cleaning, and maintenance. Break fast is provided other hotel which is convenient for the guest. It is not a place to stay in this condition.    ,Hotel is not how i would describe this disgraceful property. It is absolutely filthy, and in need of URGENT refurbishment. The staff are unhelpful , disinterested and appear to regard guests as an intrusion. Our ""ROOM"" if that is the correct term was tiny, perhaps 5 meters X 3 meters with the bed crammed into a corner to allow access to one side. No table,chair or room to put a suitcase - i refused to hang clothes in the free standing wardrobe. The bathroom was like a galley, my knees were up against the wall while seated on the toilet, had to sit to one side. No ventilation / window in the shower cubicle, which was dirty and smelly. The hot water lasted all of 60 seconds, and there was precious little room to dry yourself with a towel that had holes in it. On returning to the, ""room"" in the evening we were greeted by scurrying cockroaches over an inch long. on close inspection we found other dead ones presumeably dispatched by previous guests.  After our first night the TV had no reception, i reported this to staff who advised it was a network problem. A quick visit to the nearby Mustafer center confirmed many different channels working including one of the two provided in our room. A second complaint failed to produce the promised maintenance man and we retired early, bored with little else to do. I rarely if ever use in room mini bars and did not do so here. However on checkout the reception claimed we had used one bottle of water and demanded payment . i refused ! Our stay was during the Singapore Grand Prix and we had little or no choice of hotel. All acceptable establishments either booked out or beyond a resonable budget. Had i not already paid i would have gone back to the airport and spent the night at the AMBASSADOR TRANSIT HOTEL, - a very different proposition. Travellers beware this Doss house is  DISGUSTING ! !,…,First the one positive - its in Little India near Mustafa centre and lots of good restraunts.There are better hotels in the area, if you must stay in this area choose one. Room was tiny and filthy. No lift, unfriendly staff. Someone tried to come into room in middle of night. They 'forgot' we were there.

Yes. i saw 1 lizard in the bathroom too. hotel frontdesk staff is friendly indeed. no free mineral water but u can purchase from the vending machine at a corner... ,i have been visiting the cameron hotel since nov 1973, i always got a warm welcome each time i stayed at the cameron, it is ok for my family, it is clean safe has aircon,yes the old type but is cold, it includes a lite brekkie, boiled egg, toast, chocolate cake, tea and coffee, very relaxed and comfey, and a 10 min walk to the mrt station, with plenty of cheap cafes, and clothes shopping and gold jewellery, you can trust the jewellers here, as the singapore govt is very strict, but you do have to haggle, to get a fair price.regards jim and bas turfrey, australia.,I have never been so disgusted by a hotel . Ever. How do I even begin?!! I thought I'd like to try a hotel stay around my house area for a change.  I love all things colonial,vintage , retro. And so I thought wow this is like a great find.  Checking in was all OK UNTIL I GOT INTO THE ROOM.  The walls are disgusting with alot of black stains. The floor seems sticky i didnt dare walk around without my flipflops. At first glance the toilet seems upgraded but when look closely at the ground. It is sooo dirty! I saw 3 lizards in the toilet . There is a used plaster with blood on the sink. There are hairs on the bed.  I just couldnt take in 3 mins let alone one whole nite! The aircon seems to be on its last breath. Everyting seems so dirty I had to go home and take a bath . I actually, lost my appetite . There are actually many complaints on this hotel. Cleanliness matters. Really.  I dont know how this hotel actually managed to stay in business. Outrageous. I wish i didnt even have to give it one star!,…,I had tried to call n check room availability a few times and was informed that the cheaper room was available since I just needed a room alone to do work since my house nearby can be quite noisy due to mum majong session. However everytime I was informed that all cheaper rooms were taken up when I reached there n my house was just directly opp the hotel! Today I purposely called up when I was just standing outside the hotel to check vacancy. As usual, the man said got vacancy and the moment I approached him at counter he gave me the deluxe room (less than 10 seconds to walk in) and said the cheaper ones were all occupied and I didn't even see any single soul walked in! That's really cheating!Today, 10/2/14, my last n never ever there!,Though the location is convenient (close to airport and freight centre where most of my work is), I would not recommend this place to anybody. The hotel is not maintained well, airconditioners hardly work but make a lot of noise, floor is dirty, bathroom door was broken, breakfast was an apology of a meal - hardly anything is even passable.  Moreover, As some other reviewer had commented earlier, quite a lot of hookers frequent ths joint. I think there are also other short time users here, who use this place for illegal / immoral rendevous.  I had booked myself for 4 days, but ran away from this place after the first day. I would strongly suggest that anybody wanting to stay at this hotel better stay at their own risk.",,,,157,5,46

Where to begin. The woman (dog walker) who coordinates the glamping makes numerous false promises. The facilities were dirty, no market and not up to glamping standards at all. 325$ was courageous. Above all, she allowed a group of 8 teenagers to illegally drink in the tent next to us until 4.30 in the morning. I reported this to both the police and ministry of health officials.,Booked a large tent with party setup; calls to 8751 5339 and 9789 7022 from their website went unanswered for 30 mins and they only showed up one hour later! Cheeky buggers had the audacity to blame CUSTOMER and WEATHER for arriving 5pm, hence no large tent left. Scrambled to find replacement tent (only had medium one) and rushed setup before the 30 birthday guests were due to arrive.  As pictured, it was a complete disaster ending in tears and demand for refund. Despite agreeing to partial refund, the offer ended up being ANOTHER tent and free event tickets. Who would want a repeat experience?! Save your money and frustration, book a hotel instead.,They ruined my whole birthday. We made a booking via airbnb and paid $480 to celebrate my birthday. Set up was late, overpromise and underdelivered. Please don't ever book with them if you want to have a good time,Planned to have my daughter's birthday party at their ECP location on the 16th Aug.. made connection via whatsapp, email and phone.. made a formal booking on the 6th Aug.. paid the deposit.. sent them a reminder on the day of the event and when we reached there.. NOTHING! So disappointing!   They couldn't locate my deposit and made me send them a copy of the receipt.. refund received thereafter..  still waiting for the apology!  Horrible!",,,,24,5,53

Wir hatten ein privates Doppelbettzimmer das nicht gerade das sauberste war. Es müffelte und es fehlte an allem Komfort. Im Zimmer gab es einen Kasten aber wenn man den öffnete kam einen ein Gestank entgegen, somit war der Kasten unbrachbar.  Es gab ein Gemeinschaftsbad für Männer und eines für Frauen. Im Gemeinschaftsbad der Frauen gab es 3 WC's, in dem der Männer nur eines. Zudem gab es in jedem Gemeinschaftsbad 3 Duschrn aber nur je eine mit Warmwasser. Frühstück war inklusive.

Robinson Condo,3.0,5 reviews,#207 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,Merlion Park,free wifi,Chinatown,Chinatown,complimentary wifi,Chinatown,Booked a five night stay in a two bedroom apartment.    Arrived late at night to be put in a one bedroom cramped dirty apartment.  Sheets were stained and the bed was concave and very uncomfortable.  Sure my friend had a more uncomfortable night on the couch if that was possible.  Apparently here it is common practise to double book the rooms and put you into whatever room is available.  The room was double booked a fact confirmed by booking.com when they got my extremely irritated emails and phone calls.  Turns out it is illegal to sublet  apartments in this block, so glad we packed up and got out of there ASAP.  The owners solution to our issues when contacted was to put a single bed in the kitchen and drop the price.  Great welcome to Singapore being lied to about our, accommodation.  Pictures are not what you get and I don't believe the good reviews for this accommodation are genuine.  We stayed at the Somerset Liang Court for the next four nights in a beautiful two bedroom apartment with a view of Clarke Quay and Marina Bay Sands, which I would go back to anytime.  Strongly recommend not staying in this accommodation.  Dodgy from the moment you pick up your keys from a letter box and see the signs in the foyer saying no short term rentals allowed.,…,The best thing about Robinson Suites is the location. Easy walking distance to MRT stations, close to Chinatown and Marina Bay, and sitting on your balcony you can look down at Lau Pa Sat Hawker stalls, and smell the numerous outdoor satay stalls set up on Boon Tat Rd after 8pm. There are also a few convenience stores close by, so you have everything you need. Be warned however, that the apartment complex doesn't allow short-term visitors, so we were warned not to answer our door if anyone knocked on it complaining. This didn't end up being a problem for us in the end, and there appeared to be more foreigners in the building than long-term residents. The apartments are very small, with very little storage space, but good enough for a quick stop over where you leave most things, packed in your suitcase. We were charged a $500 SD cleaning deposit which was meant to be refunded soon after checking out, but we had to make this happen ourselves after 3 weeks of silence. In response to our emails we got confirmation of our refund (which they paid once we asked for it) but no apology. I wonder if this is usual practice?,…,We originally booked at Riverfront Condo but were transferred to this apartment shortly before we traveled.   The location was great with easy access to some great attractions.  However, the living areas were heavily marked, and the furnishings were dated and sparse. The apartment was not really set-up for travelers, it seemed to be aimed more at backpackers or student accommodation.  There was no luggage rack, no furniture on the balcony, limited drawer/wardrobe space, kitchen items were inadequate with limited glass/crockery/cutlery items, there was no compendium of services within the building or surrounding areas, and no manual for the washer/dryer.,10-15 minute walk to the Harbour- Food hall opposite with excellent street food- stand 8 the best.

The beds are clean. View is pleasant, facing the Istana. Cannot open the window for fresh air, but I suppose it's due to security considerations of being in the proximity of the Istana,We book a stay using our vouchers and scored an upgrade. The room is spacious and everything is at its top condition. Welcome box of masks and sanitizer were placed in the room.  Lovely view with full height window, I love the couch which is near the TV. I spent most of my time in the room sitting there.  Location is accessible with Millenia Walk just next to the hotel. We had one of our meals and did our simple grocery shopping at medi-ya.  Easy access to Suntec via underpass. Lots of shops at Suntec, the shopping just continued.  Our stay comes with breakfast and dinner buffet. We love the dinner, it’s ala carte buffet, you can scan QR to access their menu.   Serving is small so we tried a lot of different dishes. Seafood are fresh, I love the salmon sashimi and prawns.  , Breakfast was a letdown, it’s set menu. Somehow hotel breakfast with buffet style just felt incomplete.,…,It's good hotel . Aroud the hotel have roads. Very close to shopping centres. I stayed 19th Nov 2019. Staffs are good.  Like the hotel system. Have all facilities and foods are good.  Will visit again.  Thanks to all staffs.,Stay for 14 nights due to Stay Home Notice (SHN) upon retuned from Australia. Stayed for 130$ per night with 3 meals provided.  Hotel Location perspective i would say still pretty good , along Orchard road but not very strategic; quite outskirt along to express way; walking distance to city of Orchard.  Check in process quiet smooth ; the receptionist , Cherry from Thailand was patience enough with some of my questions especially with SHN. Very professional, even at late evening.  I was assigned to level 7, with a king bed and overall facility seems decent. And well maintained. First impression was very good.  Great part: - Surprisingly the bed was soft with 5 nice pillows given - Meals given were quite acceptable but limited choices; - Room service were quite prompt. Thumbs up, to Kym ,Mina , Rahimah and Sharon from Room service dept for excellent services rendered. They will even remind you for meal in case you missed it.  Worst part: - Internet connection coverage quite terrible, a business traveler like me really can’t stand its slowness. Internet packets kept dropped from time to time. - Service rendered from Housekeeping was quite unpleasant. Pretty bad experience. I just wondering Complimentary waters were not in the SHN package on day 2 or 3, one of the staff called Jennifer replied my request in a very rude manner : “ No water will be serving, go and boil your Own tap water!” ,I was like what a rude attitude? Just because of this she ruined my whole great impression to this hotel, a single bad blood ruined the whole body.  I am really don’t mind to go for own water boiling but why can’t the staff just talked in a nice way?And should I deserved such attitude because of hotel’s regulations which not been told?  To the hotel also, in my views if you cant fulfill the essential/ fundamental request from your customer like just a simple essentials such as water, you may want to rethink whether this is your business standpoint to sustain your business.  Check out was smooth and fast. June from reception was quite polite and efficient with well explaination. Support from Rafidah also really appreciated.  I will rate 4 stars or more if this hotel provide membership, improve on network speed and provide more professional lesson internally, especially to their housekeeping team.,…,Nice and comfortable..

We and the couple in the capsule above us tried to call the emergency number provided to us but nobody responded. This left us with no aircon and light all night as well as the fact that our capsule was open because the whole power in the capsule went off.... In the morning, the management didn't handle it well so we decided to write to the owner. We were promised a partial refund by him however after a while he stopped responding to us, no refund made. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place, very bad service and even worse management.,I wanted to experience staying in a Capsule hotel in SIngapore so with an overnight layover in Singapore I decided to try staying at this capsule hotel near Boat QUay.

Definitely stay here only for the experience and nothing else.,Location & cool concept. As I’ve tried different capsule hostel in Singapore. I’ve got early check in as i reached before 3pm and the staff allowed me to do so. Thanks for helping.  Disliked · People (a group of Indian) in the same room didn’t aware that they talked so loud. As we all know that the capsule pod is not soundproof pod. Just.. too loud.,A one star rating, rather than 2 star would be more appropriate for this accommodation. There is no communal space, little privacy and the 'deluxe' pods are very basic indeed. The website paints a much better picture than the reality.,The location is really nice. Boat Quay is a great area with lots of bars and restaurants and a nice view of the Fullerton and the Anderson Bridge. They served breakfast but it seems a bit cobbled together. Cereal and toast, water, tea and coffee. Note that there is only a small staircase and no elevator in case you bring lots of lugguage. The space pods were very clean and kinda fancy, had outlets, light, TV, AC, everything you needed. On my floor, there were 3 bathrooms and 3 showers for 18 beds total. The space itself is very limited between the pods.","Trendy,Modern",,,663,97,100

I just had to trust what I saw in the website.  Colin, one of the proprietors, was very accommodating with all of my requests for booking.  So were Anthony and Ellen (hotel staff), during our stay there.  Aces Lodges is generally clean and the occupants were decent. The trip to/from Changi Airport costs less than S$9 by taxi.  It is located in a part of Singapore which is not so busy but from where every place of interest is so accessible. For a big group like ours, we certainly found a great place to stay for a price so affordable.,This hostel is a good deal for Singapore.  Now, remember that Singapore is very expensive, so this hostel is a little pricey for what you get (when compared to others in S.E. Asia). But it is not anywhere close to any MRT station (but there is a bus station right across the road).  And its far from city center.  The staff is extremely helpful and kind!  But the rooms are very loud at night.  The noise just echoes through the hostel.  And don't count on breakfast in the morning.  Its just white bread and a toaster.,It was an comfortable trip as i have gone there for a business purposes. The room service was also fast n good, the decore of hotel was good and it was clean everywhere in the hotel.

Lots of cockroaches and mice! Obviously not a choice to stay. And there’s no 24-hour security, didn’t feel safe. So, please think twice before booking,We stay here for 3weeks, the room was good enough because there is a toilet and refrigerator (dont know if other rooms have refrigerator), cabled tv, washing area for free (wherein you can wash your clothes), they have a microwave and kitchen (you can use in cooking food with complete kitchen tools to save money as well)... Staff is very friendly especially uncle ""Michael""... Overall ratings i can give is 96%, its good because the price is cheaper but you can cook and do laundry by your own compare to other hotels you need to pay for laundry. A must visit for the tourist who want to save money.,The best thing about JJH boutique apartment in Geylang: 1. Cheap price 2. Private bathroom & toilet 3. Convenient store, restaurants and food stalls everywhere 4. Great staff working there (Michael attended to all our needs during our stay there. A friendly guy) 5. Free Wi-Fi. (not sure how fast it is, only use on mobile but it is good enough for light surfing)  The not so good about JJH boutique apartment in Geylang: 1. Quite a distance away from the nearest MRT station. 10-15 minutes walk to Aljunied station. 2. Cockroaches... you'll see one or two from time to time. 3. TV signal reception is so so.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay at JJH. The room is typically small but equipped with private bath... This place has no elevator... So, if you are not comfortable on walking up, and down stairs, be sure to let the staff know that you want a ground floor room.,…,I booked this for a friend who was moving house and didn't want to impose on the family. They stayed for about a week.   There is no 24 hours reception. It's a seedy location but still okay compared to some other lorong in Geylang. Hmmm... won't say it's very clean.. it's very dingy and super compact. Beds are... plastic thingys they put a cover over. No cleaning service.  Geylang is well known for its red light district. Set aside that reputation, it does have a lot of convenient internet cafes. Try not to go for the blue ones, they're quite expensive. There are a few hidden internet cafes that you can pay $10-15 for 10 hours straight. Geylang has also a huge array of local food to try. And of course that stretch of durian stalls!   If you're a tourist, I hope you put a little, bit more consideration into staying here. It MIGHT give you a bad impression of what Singapore has to offer. Just top up $10-$20 more, you could be staying at hotel nearby. No doubt it's still in the same seedy area. But at the very least, you have a 24 hours reception and cleaning service everyday.,…,You get what you pay for.. And in Singapore, this is probably the cheapest one you can find wd Cable, Hot water, comfortable bed, nearby access to a variety of food that may suit your palate. But and this I stress carefully, do not expect a five star or even a three star experience. This is just a place you sleep in after a tiring day of going around Singapore. For the price, its worth the negatives. ",,,,69,6,75
Bond Boutique Capsule Hotel At Bugis,4.5,13 reviews,#116 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I stayed here with a friend back in January for a few nights. It was out first time in Singapore and the location was perfect as you're on the right side of town for the airport  but can walk to Clarke Quay in about 20/25 minutes. Haji Lane is 2 minutes away too which is so good for food and drinks. The beds were comfortable and AC great as it was boiling. Breakfast was OK but was included so that was good. The staff were friendly and kindly kept my sim card behind the reception after I left it there after checking out. Would recommend!,pods are cheap but u got alot of weird guests around.last time was ok because there are standard n price bery good.i meant is high but still can affort.come back again price cheap bt no standard.room smelly o think of the shoes.strange guests talking in the middle of the nite.slamming of locker doors.xomplained to staff but no action taken.room with 26people i hope there are hse rules around. very disappointing.,Cheap and Clean place and located within walking distance to Bugis MRT station. Breakfast is only bread and cornflakes. Anyway, can’t expect much since it is cheap. However, there are many eateries around so food is not a problem. Bed was comfortable. The only downside was it is a mixed dormitory so if you are not comfortable with that, then this place is not for you. Overall, it was a comfortable stay for me. ,This capsule hotel is decent, although it is but a small subsidiary of it's larger cousins like Nuve Hotel, Nuve Heritage hotel and the likes. This capsule hotel doesn't have many beds, but it's price is decent and so definitely worth booking in advance for this place if you're on a tight budget. It is definitely worth the money.  I commend the cleanliness of the toilet and pretty good capsule pods, large enough for stayers to hang out in their own capsules. I was lucky to have very considerate backpackers during my three night stay there, and everyone basically kept to themselves, which I was completely fine with.  I was a little disappointed with it's communal area and what they had to offer. They have a small dart and target hanging on the wall, and a set of ping pong sets, sitting around with no table tennis table to be seen. There was no water dispenser or fridge, which meant i had to go out and purchase water on my own. They did have a small water boiler for use though. Expecting that their communal area would be better provisioned, I was rather disappointed with the lack there of. The communal area was also accessible to public, and didn't feel at all homey or exclusive to patrons.   Breakfast was also rather disappointing, there was only white bread, two to three kinds of spreads, packet coffee, teabags, one plain cereal option and UHT milk. And none of these items are available after breakfast.   The internet is somewhat spotty during peak hours, the 5G is not reliable in the communal area and their regular wifi becomes rather slow during peak hours of the night; to say the least since everyone would probably be using the internet then as well.   Front desk was amazing, checking in and out was very good. Staff were friendly, helpful and polite.   Overall a good experience, and I'd definitely recommend Bond Boutique Capsule Hotel, so long as you aren't fussed about breakfast or an exclusive communal area.  ,…,Had an awesome stay at this new hostel. That is located at bugis.moving around is not a problem. There are so many local food stalls around for you to try and everything and even for shopping you can just walk to Arab street or bugis street to buy some cheap and affordable stuffs. The staff are friendly and willing to help. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Will definitely return here.",,,,479,83,100
National Service Resort & Country Club,3.5,25 reviews,#233 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,My boyfriend and I booked the NSRCC Changi bungalow 35 for the BBQ and staycation.   We were both impressed by the cleanliness and the thoughtful layout of the bungalow. The bbq was located near the dining area to facilitate for easy transfer of food and fan to blow the BBQ smoke away from the inner parts of the bungalow. The bbq area also had a outdoor sink and huge bin for easy access. The bottom floor was wheelchair friendly with flat flooring. The living hall was very spacious as well. The pool was also huge with a sizeable children section. The location was also located near the Changi costal park for a scenic evening walk of morning run. Car lots is also provided near the bungalow to transfer your luggage.   Some things that were lacking which was despite the free wifi,, the internet TV with Netflix was not able to connect to the internet which was a pity. There was also the sound of planes taking off every few minutes although with the windows closed within the bungalow, it was not very loud.   Overall, we were very pleased with the experience. Some tips for fellow travellers would be to book the bungalows nearer to the bungalow reception for closest access to the pool and reception. The bungalow we booked 35P was near the pool but the access area was way near the bungalow reception instead. One may consider the sun facing of each bungalow as well that would heat up the bungalow. We were fortunate as ours only had the morning sun and did not affect the rooms. However, I observed some bungalows with their blinds closed throughout, Also a bit of common sense, keep your bungalow balcony and main doors closed as much as possible to avoid insects getting in. As clean as the bungalow is on the inside, the bungalow is still among the thriving nature.,…,After recent renovations, the nsrcc bungalow chalets have certainly made the place more liveable. The bungalows were looking very tired and old until the recent renovations. It is now clean, and close to hotel standards; naking it worth more the money.,Been here multiple times and it has always been such a wonderful time spent. The resort consist of multiple Bungalow homes for which visitors can book. Booking can be done online on their website and minimum booking period is 3D2N.   However, you can still book for a 2D1N stay but you will have to go to their registration office in-person. Each Bungalow has a HUGE living room, a small dining room, a working kitchen, 2 bathrooms (1 on lower floor, 1 on upper floor), and 2 bedrooms on the upper floor.    In terms of amenities, there is a huge swimming pool in the middle of the compound, a badminton/tennis court, basketball court, a golf course, a slot machine room for gamblers, a classy billiard room (requires everyone who enters the room, to wear covered shoes and long pants or, jeans), a bowling alley and a pool table room.   Also, right outside, there is the East Coast Park! Another good thing about this resort is that there is a free shuttle bus from Tanah Merah MRT. Unfortunately, the staff at the registration counter wont be there 24/7. Thus you can't call for service at night when needed.,…,Went to BBQ with work colleagues at NS resort and country club chalets. Each chalet is a big house with 2 bedrooms at 2nd floor. The BBQ pit is just outside the house entrance. The size of living room, dining area and kitchen is spacious and generous. A good place for quiet getaway for friends and families. ,the bungalow is super big!! perfect for hosting large numbers of people. only downside is that its pretty secluded and to get out of the area you have to wait for the shuttle bus that only operates every 30 mins.",,,,,,

Please don't risk to get bitten all over your body. They ruined my holiday. I booked and payed in advance for 6 nights, left after the second, stil working on trying to get back my money. Coacroaches in the bathroom. Staff is only one very rude person who does not speak an English which you can understand. I saw few conflict situation during my stay, other guest could not understand as well. If the hot water kanne is gone, he says I don't know. If you ask anything he don't care. The place is incredibly dirty, smells on pi. Many workers not many tourists. Reception is random, when receptionist is there time to time. Breakfast is nothing, no place to sit, if finished no refill. Please go to a clean and nice place, instead of this and save your self what I went through.,…,Room have bedbugs.No daily cleaning.Internet wifi frequency poor.Location good.Accomodation have paid cash but still charge credit card.Worst no record receipt given.Moody receptionist and difficult communicate to chinese man,In my whole traveling experience, this is by far the worst. Arrived tired because we came from KL by land travel. Guy at front desk asked for our confirmation and for 20SGD deposit. When i asked him where the breakfast would be served, he answered me in mandarin (i cant understand) so i asked again. he still answered in mandarin and so i asked for the 3rd time, he got up annoyed and showed me where. our room was on the third floor but no elevator. on the way to our room, we could hear someone coughing/gagging like he was sick or something and we could still hear him even if we were in our room already. no towels. guests can freely smoke by the bathroom/fire exit area. not much space for 4 people.,This hotel is cheapest in Little India Area. But cheap comes with a consequence. This hotel's quadruple room is very small, that 4 people cannot move easily inside the room. They also do not change bed sheets for every new guest, bed sheet we had smells bad. Also, no free towels. Toilet also has destroyed windows, not safe to shower naked.,For budget traveling. Nice staff. Bread for breakfast with tea, coffee. $20 deposit for locker key. Staff leave you alone. Place to hang out at the entrance on sofa and also outside door.

"Ann Siang House, The Unlimited Collection by Oakwood",4.5,140 reviews,#83 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,English,"Share, ,Ann Siang Hill was such a breath of fresh air, even though it's situated at the heart of Chinatown. It was a one-night staycation, but I thoroughly enjoyed the decor and comforts of the room. The old world charm is something you have to experience for yourself in their rooms. Each room has a different layout, which adds to the charm. The toilet is squeaky clean, so I felt very at home. Service is warm and excellent, rooms are quiet. Oh, and the best pizza in Singapore is located on the ground floor. I don't know what's lacking in this place! Thank you for the lovely memories! A very neat place and hope to be back with friends!,My girlfriend and I only stayed for one night. But this was long enough to get a sense of what makes the hotel special. The beautifully restored old building contains all the mod cons you'd expect from a boutique hotel...from the Nespresso machine to Samsung Smart TVs. Add to that the prime central location and you have all the makings of a great stay,Greeted by friendly staff who showed me around the hotel lobby. Self help pantry and laundry available should any guest require. Feels like a home away from home. Rooms & common area are tastefully decorated comparable if not better than many branded hotels. And not to mention big plushy bed! Loving the way the hotel puts in effort to be eco friendly ( refillable glass water bottles and large bottles of good quality toiletries). Most of all, we accidentaly left something behind which the staff were kind enough to notify us promptly. Kudos to housekeeping and front desk! Thumbs up for your hospitality.   Be it looking for a local staycation experience or a touring Singapore the traditional + modern twist experience that Ann Siang House provide is definately worth checking out. ,The property is a shophouse converted into a boutique hotel.   Prior to checking in Dinesh was the point of contact assigned to me. He was very helpful and professional in following up with the arrangements I made. At the hotel, I was assured by Sandy who was prompt in attending to my requests.   The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was modern and the amenities were luxurious. The bed was extremely comfortable especially for someone with chronic insomia problems like myself. As the hotel is newly built,  the fixtures and fittings were brand new and in good working order.   Rooftop bar is amazing. Lots of variety to choose from. Friendly and helpful staff.   The hotel while quiet was also adjacent to the central business district; it would be suitable for business, travellers or tourists. Access to the heart of China Town and Downtown within 5-10 mins of walking.   Highly recommended. Good value for money, standards on par with 5 star hotels and other big chains.,…,I spent a while looking for places to stay in Singapore.  If anyone else reading this is doing the same thing then you will see that most of your options appear to be 1) stay in an expensive hotel that you know will be great but you pay for the privilege 2) stay somewhere mid to high range with good reviews but appears to be far from the city 3) stay somewhere with not great/average reviews but is ""cheap"" for Singapore standards.  This place was one of the few places that I found that was within walking distance (up to an hour's walk you could see most things) to everything I wanted to visit, with consistently good reviews and in the mid/mid high (for Singapore) price range.    Location - Great! I didn't want to use the metro as was there at the beginning of the Coronavirus, outbreak so we walked everywhere which was possible from this hotel's location.  I also really liked the area which had loads of bars and restaurants nearby and a nice vibe to it.  Room - Superb!  We were in a really quiet room in the hotel and didn't hear any noise at all outside the room while we were there.  The room had full blackout blinds so was completely dark if you wanted it to be.  The bed was large and comfortable with plenty of pillows.  The shower was powerful and always hot and they had awesome large shower gel and shampoo dispensers that never ran out.  The room was also clean.  Food - Don't know!  The reviews I read before we got to the hotel were people saying breakfast was only toast so we slept in!  Have just seen a recent review though saying it was bread, cheese, salami etc and was good!   Rest of the hotel - Great - The hotel has complementary washing machines and dryers which were REALLY useful!! In the time we were there we washed and dried all of our clothes as there was nobody else using the machines.  There also appeared to be a bar on the top of the hotel that seemed busy, given there were often people in the lifts going up there, but we didn't go up there.  There were large glass water bottles in the room and could fill them up with free water in reception.  Staff - Great - The staff were perfectly pleasant and were flexible to let us stay beyond our half day check out time on the last day we were there as we had a late night flight back.  Given the hotel was not full this was something that was sensible for them to do but so many places would not have done this so.  Overall this hotel was just a great final experience to round off our trip and I was really satisfied with it.,…",,,,1051,128,100
Superb Hub @ Bugis City,3.0,23 reviews,#188 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,Superb I needed to get from Seville to Vilamoura. Driver Estaban kept me informed as to pick up point and that he was running 5-10 mins late. Very good driver. Swift but safe. Couldn't get me all the way to my home but made sure he dropped me by a taxi rank to finish my journey. Will definitely use again.,We stayed at this hostel one night in Singapore - and it was clean but not good. Se stayed at a private room - but the room did not seem to be private at all. There seem to be just a thin piece of wood to the room beside  - so we could hear everything. Meanwhile they charged everything. If we wanted to borrow a towell it costed money - just everything. The area is great - but that was about it.,Superb Hub is like what its name stated, superb. It is clean & comfortable enough. I went with my cousin sister for Christmas shopping & we had a room with double decker bed. It is very small with a dressing table. Sort of like we can stand on our bed n our room door. That constraint like Hong Kong. Only cleaner. The owner or keeper I am not sure, are 2 friendly & helpful elderly couple with a pair of tame Shih-Tzus. Muslims may reconsider this place but for non Muslims, it is ideal as its near Bugis MRT station about 400m away. Separate bathroom which is quite a hassle but if you don't mind, it is ok,According to the name of the hostel it had quit a name to live up to ""Superb Hostel"". Maybe we missed to superb side of the hub, cause we stayed only one night there.   We arrived in the evening from Mersing Malaysia and planed to spend a few days in Singapore. So we heard about the place from a French family we meet on our journey.  A nice old lady checked us in, it turns out that she was the owners morther and she was over 70 years old and still working.   The room was basic with a bunk bed and clean sheets. There was access to toilets on every floor and common shower cabin on the top floor (3rd floor). Where you can find a small kitchen. Superb Hostel is located near the Arab district, which got plenty of trendy coffee shops and boutiques. But it is far from Ochard Road or, China Town if you are on foot.  Our room was on the first floor and had a large window front towards the street. And the walls was very thin and we could hear the smallest sound of our neighbours. During the night we hear them make some intimite sounds too! Besides the lack of privacy the thin walls doesn't give you a sense of security.  That's the reason for this low rating from us.,…,I actually stayed at this hostel on September 2010...it was the formula 1 weekend and I was really excited about my first international trip and watching my favorite sport live...the hostel was quite good for the price I paid at that time (35 SGD per day) it had shared bathrooms, they would charge $1 for a few basic amneties but that was ok...I didn't mind...the rooms were small...had bunk beds and no windows....it was air conditioned and we had free high speed internet all the time....again we didn't mind as we were mostly out and returned late for rest....the host was was very friendly and we always had a bottle of water delivered to our rooms at no charge....the location of this hostel was very good...about 5 mins away from the MRT and close to anywhere you want to go. All in, all I would recommend this to the budget traveler who does not want to spend much but wants to enjoy the splendor Singapore has to offer.,…",,,,513,86,100

And also in the morning the man which also the staff help me to get a ride to the nearest MRT station he get me there because my ankle was sore. It was great to have those kind of service at no addtional cost. Sure for budget travellers you should stay at this hostels.,I go here on december 2015. This hostel near lavender mrt, around 10minute by walk. The staff here very friendly. Then, the bedroom was good. But the bathroom is too small even im asian.  If wanna stay for one night, its okay:),We rent the biggest room for five of us. The bedroom is decent and the bed is clean.   The washrooms were dirty, there were three washrooms, two of them did not have drain so the water from 1st washroom would flow to the second and the second would flow to the third, filthy.   The toilet space were too small, you could not even sit properly and close the door. Unacceptable.  The washroom sinks were never cleaned. Filthy.  The facility was also functioning as a storage for the owner other business. The hostel was cluttered with many items that have no reason to be there (e.g.: signage post for other business)  What I need is clean bed and clean washroom, the rest are unnecessary.,Although it is well located, room sizes are quite small yet neat and clean. Best thing is the surrounding market where you can try local foods. Pocket friendly for backpackers. They are a bit strict with rules and ask you to sign an agreement before they allow you to stay in.,This place is really, really, cramped. If you are claustrophobic, you better stay away. It has no foyer, no shared place to comfortably rest after steamy Singapore sightseeing. We got ""private"" room with four beds with literally no wall between second room. That is, wall is there, but there is 5cm gap making you hear perfectly clear every little noise in the second room. As it happened, it's inhabitants returned at 2am and for half an hour had some sort of Chinese loud and fun party. The room was so small that we constantly tripped over our backpacks staked between our beds.",,,,254,23,94

Baños sucios (llenos de pelos, y jamás vimos que haya una persona limpiando), cocina/espacio común sucio, con hormigas por toda la mesa, y diminuto para un piso de 3 habitaciones, donde no duermen menos de 26 personas. Reservamos habitación de 12, donde terminamos siendo 14, dado que el personal del hostel dejaba que tres amigas de ellos compartieran una cama. No obstante eso, estas tres personas se la pasaron molestando a toda hora (hablando, moviendo bolsas, yendo y viniendo toda la noche). El desayuno es ilimitado y se puede comer en cualquier horario (ofrecen pan, peanut butter, nutella y mermeladas, con café). Creo que fue el único punto positivo del lugar.,esta ubicado en el barrio , muy cerca de la estación bugis.. muy limpio, muy buen aire en el dormitorio que es fundamental en asia, desayuno a toda hora, lo unico que se puede criticar es q no tiene un espacio comun, solo un muy pequeño lugar para desayunar, si vas por estadia corta es buen hostel.. si quieres conocer gente es un poco complicado por lo que dije.. pero si recomiendo el hostel,Good location next to Bugis Station and Bugis Street, you have a lot of options for eat and drinking around.. the hostel is in the Arabic district, but 25 minutes by foot of Marina Bay. Or 2 station (blue line) to Little India…   Safe and clean,The hostel looks very new and modern. Spend there 3 nights and enjoyed it. Even if its very tight, you don't feel uncomfortable. The bathrooms are very clean (with 24 people staying there), the toilets modern and the sinks the best I've found in a hostel.  Beds were comfortable, not to hard, not to soft - blankets fresh and clean, pillows soft. AC in the room, but no window!!  Breakfast is great (all-day/all-night): Toast, Nutella, Peanutbutter, Jam, tea, coffee  Its 3 walking minutes away from the arab street, 10 minutes with the bus to Little India or 15/20 minutes to Marina Bay. Bus station is a 2 minutes walk, next MRT is 10 minutes away.

Its like a dorm . If your traveling in solo you can stay in there. I stayed there because they offer breakfast, to my surprise the breakfast was like biscuits and tea.,Actually this Place does not deserve one Point!!!! The Manager lives in there, too. He is very unfriendly even if you just ask for toiletpaper which is always empty.  The rooms are very dirty, dark and smelly. But bedbuggs loves it there!!!! For 30 People, there´s just one toilet and shower, which are very dirty, too. There should be breakfast, but I´ve never seen it. Unfortunately I can´t say anything nice about this stay. I would never ever retourn there or recommend this place. Save your money and go somewhere else!!!!!,I wont stay here for the 2nd time. The reason I did is for the price for our group. It had the most reasonable price at that time. The motel has 3-4 rooms, all with 6-10 bunker beds. It has only one bathroom, so image the line in the morning if all the rooms are full. The breakfast was bread, biscuit, hot water, and that's it. The bad experience was that our door was knocked at night just because I forgot to wash my mug. The hallway was narrow and dark. I guess electricity is that expensive in Singapore. Positive thing is that the manager have cheap tickets for Universal Studios, Singapore Wheel, etc. Ask him for one. It's 15 minutes walk to the MRT, 3 minutes to a bus stop.,This dormitory is located in a not nice area of the city. It is rather clean, but just as a basic student dorm. It is not a hotel, and not good for families at all. There are many beds in a room, and I am not sure if the sheets are changed after guests leave. The AC is controlled by the owner, so you should ask him not to turn if off when you're sleeping because otherwise he does! You have to use shared toilet and shower, which are below standard both. The breakfast is nothing you can count on, it's just some tea bags and biscuits, and we preferred not to eat them as they didn't look fresh.  I wouldn't recommend the place for couples and families.,Stayed at the Grace Lodge for one night stop over. After reading the reviews here and on agoda I expected a basic clean place just good for one night. Rooms are what you expect at a backpackers place. There is nothing to complain about for that price in Singapore. The staff guy was helpful and friendly. But... When we got there by 4pm  we could hardly get into the house and reception area, as the small space was packed with bags, bottles. It was difficult to get the luggage inside and we couldnt see the reception desk at all. In front of the reception desk was a bin overloaded with trash. This trash was still not emptied when we left at 6am next morning. The kitchen area was filled with dirty plates and cups, clothes for drying and another overloaded bin, which also wasnt, cleaned up before we left. In the reception area there are two computers just next to the door and they were used non stop by the staff member and his friends until late night. Instead of cleaning up the mess, the staff guy was busy playing computer games. When we got up early morning, he had a friend over who slept in the sofa in the reception area and he slept on the floor behind the reception. By then the table in this area was fully covered with old food containers. In conclusion, beds ok, the orgininal idea of this place quite nice, but maintainance and reception/kitchen area is a catastrophe and out of my perspective so dirty, that is is a no go place.,…",,,,32,4,48

The Hostel is perfectly placed and comes as expected. The staff is super friendly. Due to the corona outbreak we came into the situation, that our luggage was stored in the hostel while we had to fly to germany. The staff helped greatly sending back our stuff. Thank you!,There were some great aspects of this place, and I’d love to recommend it, but overall, I cannot, due to lack of cleanliness and insect bites in the dorms.   Positives: Extremely friendly and helpful staff, nice free breakfast, great social environment and common areas. The location was also excellent for exploring the city, located in the heart of little India and very close to all transport.   Negatives: Do not stay here if you plan on getting a restful night’s sleep, as you will hear very loud music from the clubs across the street until 3am, at least on weekends. Better for partying than resting. My biggest complaint however was that I left here with more insect bites than I’ve ever had anywhere in Southeast Asia. It’s possible that it was mosquitoes, which I realize the, hostel would have little control over, but I’m actually fairly confident that the bites are from bedbugs instead, which is a dealbreaker for me in a hostel.   I would love to love this place, and I would say it was a pleasant overall experience if not for bedbugs. ,…,it s really good hostel many people every where booked in that hostel they offre free trip with scooter arround singapour city also they offre some tea free  they are computers for free use and so speed internet you can make friendship from worldwide there,Good budget hostel.  Excellent breakfast with lots of food (hard boiled eggs!!) that never runs out.  The front desk staff were extremely helpful, helping out with light rail schedules, free city tours available and lots of local incite!  The location of the hostel is also great (!) within walking distance of most attraction (in my 5 day stay in Singapore, I only used the light rail on one day - mainly to go and see the botanical garden).  The downside.  The beds are just ok - I've slept on better and I've slept on worst.  There is no privacy, so I had to use two blankets to make curtains (luckily I was in the bottom bunk).  The lockers were a little bit small, but good enough to put valuables.  The toilets and showers definitely need updating (yuk!)  Overall, I'd stay there, again, but request a bottom bunk so I can make makeshift curtains . . . .,…,Loved this hostel! Such a convenient location and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Unbelievably cheap for what it is, especially considering the free breakfast (there was always plenty to eat and enough for as much as you want). They also do a free scooter tour which was 3-4 hours long... it was brilliantly done with two free water/light shows that we stopped at and places for food and major sites, including the Supertrees and Marina Bay. When we asked for suggestions the staff remembered us and tailored recommendations with loads of detail and really helpful info. Couldn't have tried harder to be accommodating. Also a really nice atmosphere with everyone hanging out downstairs and the scooter tour was a good way to at least recognise some friendly faces around, the hostel. Clean and nice bedding too.

Thad's Boutique Hostel,4.5,131 reviews,#35 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Electric vehicle charging station,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,There are the 2 female Malay receptionists cannot listen and cannot smile.. Hotel rule is to open the door and switch the aircon 11AM until 2 PM.. And they didn’t come back at all.I slept without aircon. Next day they turned it on until i had cough.  And they never informed guests have to exchange the towel at the lobby. Everyone who stayed a night they left the towel. After they left nobody collect it.  ability is so poor.. Never do sth you pleased.  If you need anything they’ll not help and give their stupid fu..ed up face all the time..,I stayed here twice during my trip through Singapore and Malaysia and enjoyed myself very much. The staff were really good to me and the hostel conditions were very good, including the free breakfast - several food options are nearby including some awesome baos. Outram Road Station is a bit of a walk but I didn't find anything wrong with this place.,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this accommodation!  6 mixed dorm, very quiet and relaxing. Friendly staff. Clean common areas Large electronic lockers within bed area Easy 10 minute walk the closest station Would stay again! ,I stayed in a co-ed 8 people room with no ensuite bathroom. I loved Thads for various reasons. There is room for improvement, however.   Location. The location is central and the bus is just across the street. There are various options for food-- Tiong Bahru market has great eats. Under Thad's hostel is a cool bar and it does get loud on the weekends. It wasn't a problem for me. The area is in an older part of Singapore, but I felt safe.  Hostel amenities. All basic necessities are there, but you get a new towel only every other day. I love the in-bunk storage. I'd just unpack and put everything in there and that made life very convenient. Their water refilling station is awesome. There is basic breakfast every morning, but there is so much food in the neighborhood (talking, about $2-3 per plate and $1 fresh sugar cane juice), I'd rather eat at the hawkers nearby. There are 2 bathrooms with a  rainfall shower and 2 sinks. Washer and dryer available for $4 each use. Most people used the washer and dried their clothes on a small dry rack across the lounge area.  Comfort. The sheets and bedding were hotel quality and I was really comfortable.  The bed is on the harder side, but I prefer a harder bed in general. The AC was super strong and it feels amazing during the hot day, but I'd wake up with sniffles in the morning.   My 2 biggest complaint: TOWELS AND VENTILATION. The towel rack/luggage rack in the room reeked because of the poor ventilation. The towels never dried while in the rooms. My bed was right next to the towel rack and the mildew smell permeated in my space. I brought it to front desk's attention and asked for another bed. I was told they would open the doors to the rooms and let the rooms air out between 11-3. I was thinking it meant towels would air out for 4 hours. That wasn't the case-- housekeeping opens the room only while cleaning and then it gets closed when they are done. By the next day, it still stank. On the 2nd night I used perfume in my bunk to mask the smell. 8 mildew/wet towels in a small space, just imagine. It also didn't help when one of the girls there onky did her laundry once during her 5 week stay in Singapore. So her stuff smelled bad. I was 1 foot from all the smelliness. Finally, the problem was resolved when a bunch of people checked out on the 3rd day of my stay.,…,I have stayed for almost 2 weeks in this hostel with one weekend in between. For me, being almost 2 meters tall the beds were a bit short but I cannot complain about that as for a regular person the beds should be big enough. The matras was comfortable and the sheet were clean. Every morning a basic breakfast is served consisting of bread/toast en cereals with milk,juice, coffee and tea. If you want to relax you can either go out to the patio's or get a drink at the bar attached to the hostel.   The second week I spent at the hostel I was in an other room directly located next to the bathrooms. I could hear the water running pretty well when someone was taking a shower or flushing the toilet which is one of negatives. Furthermore the matras was less comfy as it was less thick, and could feel some spings inside. But I still had some good sleeps.  In conclusion, I enjoyed staying at the hostel and the personal was really friendly to help whenever was needed!,…","Trendy,Charming",,,98,16,94

AC not working properly  3. Room very small, almost the size of bed.  4. Dirty mugs (coffee leftover still in the mug) 5. Washroom is dirty, tabs knobs broken and dysfunctional, leakage in washroom, washbasin strainer not there, dropped a jewellery and lost it in the basin, flush not functional, very dirty seat, very unhygienic. 6. Roof dripping  7. Dirty tables, hair, dirt everywhere.  ,decent room for what you pay, good location and public transport nearby, around the corner on Geylang Road lots of eateries that are open till late or even 24 hours... frontdesk takes a deposit from creditcard which they will return in 14 working days,Literary the worst place I've ever stayed at. Bathroom was absolutely filthy, mould everywhere, toilet had hair behind the toilet ring. Absolutely disgusting! Shower is literally on top of the toilet which seems like a norm in cheaper hotels here. I don't mind that the room was small, but the hygiene was absolutely non-existent We left ...,The only reason why we booked this hotel was because we needed a budget stay, and that's what we got. Positives: good location, right by the National Stadium, good connections to the city center, many local restaurants around. Nice view. Negatives: staff seemed unbothered at check-in and in general (though one of the men was friendlier). We had to ask for cleaning service, the toilet paper was not refilled. Of our 4night stay there was warm (not hot!) water only the first night, the rest - cold water. The room itself was okay though outdated and small. WiFi okay as well. The bed wasn't comfortable either. Our worst experience was the bathroom - not sanitary, mold Everywhere! Not properly cleaned either. The water wasn't draining down properly thus an unpleasant smell as a, result.. Flushing the toilet was a challenge in itself as there didn't seem to be enough water pressure. The reception mentioned that the hotel is up for a renovation so hopefully they'll be able to optimize all the above. My recommendation as of today is - better find another place to stay, hostel is way better.,…,Our graduate school class visited Singapore more than a month ago to benchmark in several of its noted educational institutions. We opted to stay in an affordable but decent hotel which we assumed was near the schools we visited. It was easy on the pocket - my classmate and I paid less than 50 SD per night for our room. It had a queen-sized bed, flat screen TV, electric kettle, water heater in the bathroom, and a well-functioning a/c unit. Those were all that we needed, anyway. We also had a good view of the highway and the National Stadium from our window. In fact, the National Stadium was near enough for us to go to and exercise a couple of mornings. The staff (except for one) was cordial and helpful. The locals said that the place was the red-light district but did not feel, it at all. The nearest MRT station (Kallang) was a 10-15 minute walk away. Didn't mind walking back to the hotel at all. It was good exercise. Changi Airport was only around 20 minutes away. I only paid 9 SD for the airport shuttle going to Oxley. Geylang Road was only less than a five-minute walk away. That was where you can choose to dine from a good number of restaurants and buy from convenience stores. The hotel provided a fresh supply of three-in-one coffee sachets and bottled mineral water everyday. We were able to sleep well at night. It was a peaceful neighborhood. The only complaint I can think of was that there was a little portion of the tiled floor of the bathroom where water accumulated whenever we showered. Other than that, we think got more than our money's worth during our stay at Oxley.,…",Budget,,,164,25,76

The hotel is really for backpackers; no frills, just the neccessities of tourist living.  The double decker beds are okay; the linens are clean; the pillows are fine.

Close by to several subway stations and was very reasonable for a nights stay in Singapore! The WiFi was really strong and worked well. Free breakfast was a great touch too! The 24 person dorm was fairly cramped and sometimes there was a queue for the toilets and showers with their only being two of each for 24 people to share. Big lockers to fit a lot of your belongings into. Showers didn’t have the greatest pressure but were warm. For the price we paid an okay stay in Singapore! ",,,,327,22,97

So I made a decision to change my blanket to another bed. In the morning I tried to talk to the receptionist but they said they gave me the clean blanket. I showed them some pictures and they didn’t believe it. The point is, they still want to charge me for $40 😂.,I’ve stayed in a number of capsule hotels in Japan so had an idea of what to expect and it didn’t disappoint. For the price and location you really can’t complain. Everything you need for a simple stay, very friendly staff and comfortable and clean accommodations ,Great location! Along Circular Road, you may already find cheap restaurants there. There are also Bars and Party Pubs nearby so expect parked cars along the way and people having night drinks.

Far East Plaza Residences by Far East Hospitality,4.5,486 reviews,#14 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"Chinese, Malay","Share, ,My adult daughter and I have just returned home after spending 10 nights at Far East Plaza Residences.  We arrived at around 7.45 a.m., definitely not expecting our room to be ready and asked the security guard if we could please leave our bags with him so that we could go out and return at check-in time.  He suggested that we return at 9 a.m. when the office would be open just to check if there was a vacant room available at that time.  We went and had breakfast and returned at 9.30 a.m.  At the office we were greeted by a smiling Vimala and offered some nice cold water.  She said that our room would be ready at 11 a.m. and that we could wait in their atrium lounge area on the 7th floor.  Just before 11 a.m. she popped her head over the balcony and called down that our room was, ready.  We really appreciated the effort that staff went to in order to provide us with our room prior to check-in time.  We had booked a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment, however we were upgraded to a two bedroom, two bathroom because the category we booked was not available.  The two bed, two bath configuration suited us perfectly.  It was dated and requires renovation, but it was very spacious and clean.  There was a queen sized bed in the main bedroom and two singles in the other.  The beds were comfortable and the linen was of good quality and perfectly clean.  In the wardrobe of the main bedroom was a safe, a clothes airer, an iron and ironing board, scales, hangers and a linen hamper.  There was ample hanging space and drawers in both bedrooms and the main bedroom also had a flat screen TV.  The bathroom off the main bedroom had a shower over the bath and twin sinks.  The water pressure was strong and hot water was always available.  The towels were thick and fluffy and shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, soap, shower cap and toothbrushes and toothpaste were provided.  The minor bathroom had a walk-in shower, single basin and toilet.  The kitchen was well equipped with oven, hotplates, microwave and a washing machine.  Dishwashing liquid, sponge and tea towel were provided and there was ample crockery and cutlery and small appliances such as kettle and toaster.  A starter kit of tea bags, milo sachets, coffee sachets, instant noodles, biscuits and chips was also a nice touch.  The lounge area had a sofa, coffee table and flat screen TV and there was a dining setting which seated four in the dining area.  The air conditioning worked well as did the free WIFI, except for once when we could not connect, however a friendly technician attended to our problem within minutes of it being reported.  The level of service which we received from the technician was indicative of the service offered by all the staff we came into contact with.  Greetings and offers of assistance were the order of the day.  Every time we saw the security guards as we entered and left the premises they always gave us a friendly wave and greeting.  We mentioned to the technician in passing that we were having trouble finding out where to buy a kite and, hey presto, just after he left an email arrived from Suzanna listing a number of possible places where we could buy one.  The location of these apartments is perfect as they are just a couple of hundred meters from Orchard Road and Orchard MRT station.  Our apartment on the 12th floor overlooked Scotts Road so we did have quite loud traffic noise, however we were so tired at night that it didn't bother us.  Perhaps ask for an apartment on the other side of the building if you're easily disturbed by traffic noise.  All in all, we had a very comfortable stay with excellent service from the nicest people who really cared about our wellbeing.,…,I recently had a girls week with my two sisters and three neices staying at Far East Plaza, Singapore. Three of the group had never travelled overseas so I wanted them to have a great experience for their first trip. Far East Plaza delivered that. We arrived at 8.30am all very tired from the overnight flight. I asked if it was possible for an early check-in, the security staff advised us to come back at 9.00am when the office would be open which we did, our apartment was indeed ready for us. I requested a refurbished three bedroom apartment, we spent one night in an unfurnished apartment then transferred to the new one the follow afternoon.  Both apartments were well equipped, even though the older apartment was a bit on the tired side it was still very clean,beds very, comfortable and very thing required of a serviced unit. The refurbished one was great, beautifully appointed, spacious and we were all very impressed. I must make mention of the helpful staff and in particular Lavenia who initially took our booking and Dominic, the duty Manager, they were so helpful and accommodating. Far East is ideally situated for shopping, the three cousins shopped every day, even if it was after we had been sightseeing during the day, they hit the shops in the evening. They even began using the Metro on there own as it such an easy service to use, particularly if you use  the tourist pass. We have decided on a return trip next year and we will stay at Far East.,…,Stayed in the 2 bedroom standard apartment, with my mum and 2 daughters. This place is dated but clean and tidy. Beds firm but fine, cleaning service every 2nd day was great. And they really do a great job. The pool is refreshing and great to have. The location is just perfect, find the best shops just moments away. Taxi's everywhere so cheap. Shops galore and choices to many to choose. Food on every corner an more. The kitchen and washing machine was great, a holiday with no piles of washing when u get home. Could of packed less and brought more. Far east apartment is great clean budget accomodation with great pay tv & Internet free. I would recommend it for a ease free stay. I love my 5 stars but this was ok.,Went with my sister for 9 day break. Booked 2 bed apartment. Upgraded to a 3rd bed which made for great space. 1 room ensuite and nice large shower in the other bathroom. Large clean pool. The whole block is showing its age but the beds were large and comfy. Friendly warm staff. Laurance and colleagues very helpful with sign posting for bus or rail and booking taxi. Based more in the shopping district so you need to get bus into bay area. Transport is within walking distance. Taxi to airport less than 30 Singapore dollars and much easier to use than big bags. Supermarket in area is expensive. Take your own tea bags! Best meal we had local to apartments was Nan Na on 4th floor (not ground floor one) looks awful inside but great food. Also Hans Gluk for burgers and salads. Great, vibe and taste was amazing. Wine is very expensive in Singapore. Try and visit Little India (Spice Junction) and China town food lane. ,…,Its our second time stay at Far East Plaza. Really appreciating how they care their guest. Especially thanks to Suzana. She is very helpful. Its was nice place to stay at the centre of the city.

Near a good Halal restaurant, I forgot the name but it is not hard to miss  as lines are long during lunch time. Near grocery store and 711 Near major bus stop Convenient. Hotel manager is thoughtful --- thank you Uncle for the umbrella! :),This little gem of a hotel, situated in one of Singapore’s colourful heritage districts was a very pleasant option for a night’s stay after arriving late to Changi. Located on Joo Chiat street and in the heart of the action, its main impression was left on us by way of the service that we received from the staff and manager, who went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  Aside from that, the room was basic but nice, possibly in need of a few updates and there was a spot or two on the carpet, although these didn’t affect our overall experience. Also, the walls seemed to be quite thin as we were able to hear just about everything that was being said in the next room! However, at this hotel’s very affordable price point, in an otherwise, expensive city, we could not complain.  We didn’t try breakfast but the adjoining cafe looked quite appealing - we would definitely stay again if we end up in this part of Singapore in future.,…,I stayed almost 4 months in aqueen heritage joo chait road,During my stay I did not feel any challenges.

She started by insinuating that we needed showers and rushed us through looking at the services as if we were vagrants. She then told us that we couldn't sleep in the lounge. She was so awful that we left immediately. This is something management should look into. Would have gladly paid for services there otherwise.,For a long stay it’s probably better to use the early airport checkin and go through immigration as the options are better. There’s also no vegetarian options on the menu.

I asked Haven management about this by email, and got this very quick reply:- ""Unfortunately, due to security reasons, guest cannot leave the lounge without their luggage for more than 30 mins. However, there is a left baggage counter located at the same level. You can leave your baggage with them."",I had the unfortunate opportunity to visit this so-called lounge while waiting for a friend to pick me up.   The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of attention at the front desk. No one welcomed me until I announced that I wanted to use the lounge.   Then without giving me a brief of what this place is about, the receiptionists asked for how many hours. I said i need to wait for about 4 hours for my friend and maybe take a nap. So the only option was 5 hours. They took my credit card and charged it. And when i again asked about the nap they both looked surprised and said that this was not included. When i showed my frustration they both got agitated. When they offered to void and recharge i just couldnt be bothered, having just arrived from a long flight and, exhausted. And the whole voiding process will take ages. They obviously didnt understand that pssengers coming here are tired and just needed to rest.   Anyway the lounge itself is crap. Food and drinks are crap. I would have gotten better food at a restaurant outside. The place was filled with very noisy people and there was no decorum whatsoever. Aside from some pieces of toast, there were only some tidbits, cereal, INSTANT NOODLE, and cold and hot average drinks. And the funny thing is, this lounge visit only came with one main dish which even that was crap.   My advice to you is save your cash and go find a regular restaurant in this airport. In fact, you may be better off going to the Mcdonalds across the hall. If there was a lower rating i could give, i would.   ,…,Changi Airport has a few hotels INSIDE the airport proper, but if you have to exit immigration and claim bags your choices are limited to two: The Crown Plaza at about $200 US/night, or this wonderful short term lounge, with meals, showers and functional nice little sleeping rooms.  3 hours is about $80 SG nett, with an additional $15 SG nett per hour after (all taxes included).

I could stand in the, bathroom and touch both walls without straightening my arms and I am a small person ( 5'4 125#). The TV didn't work and the wifi was spotty. Construction would start at 9am every morning and was earsplitting and unrelenting. There was dirt and dust everywhere.  There was a sign at street level advertising rooms by the hour so that should tell you all you need to know about what kind of place this is!,…,Basically we walked into a construction site. There were workers all over the building, they did not more to allow us to pass, they had tools lying all over the corridors, the place smelt of paint and there was dust everywhere.  Once in the room I found the corridor was not wide enough to open my case but the lay out was not bad, what did cause me concern was that the rooms were filthy due to all the construction, they was dust on all the shelf, and carpet and no soap, shampoo or such in any of the dispensers in the bathroom.   Construction started at 9 am every morning but you could hear the builders talking loudly outside the room long before that.  If you are on a tight budget and don’t mind dirt this is ok but it’s not for me. Also I noticed when I checked in you can rent, rooms for 1 to 2 hours at a time so I guess that says a lot about the place.,…,never ever stay in this kind of hotel，expensive with around $100pernight,$30 pernight is more than enough！too dirty，too noisy as renovation work in process. unclear information for guest easily made Customer confuse！,Why would anyone choose to stay here? I didn’t know what got into me when booking this place. The pictures look nice but not in reality. Stayed 2 days and couldn’t find one staff to check in or out. The room is extremely small. Super dirty. Toilet is the squatting type. I would give a 0 Star if I could. Please avoid unless you just need to place to crash such as backpackers. ,I don’t Normally write about bad hotels but this was the pits for the money and that’s say something from a experienced backpack 1st hard to find walk past it twice the all place need a good wash down dirty from the entrance to the room the only clean.thing was the bedding had to clime over the bed to get to the bathroom and in the morning had to listen to the other guest use us the shared bathroom.

Mercury Backpackers' Hostel,3.0,178 reviews,#244 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,Dorm room are good for me as solo backpacker, room is clean and near with Lavender MRT Station. Not recommended for family stay because the hostel specially for backpacker only. so far everything is good for me.,So I planned to stay in Singapore for 3 nights with 3 of my friends. We were a total of 4 people, and decided to buy the hostel room on 3rd floor with 2 double bed bunker beds. We had a terrible experience :  CONS :  1. The BEDS WERE ABOUT TO FALL OFF - they were so weak everytime one of my friends climbed up we feared it would break.  2. The room was despairingly small. I realise it is a hostel, but it literally only has space for 2 people and their luggage - and it was made a 4 bed room.   3. There are NO CLEANING services whatsoever inside the room - your room will remain the same as it was 4,5 days.  4. The worst part of the hostel was the breakfast. I mean you get that you are paying less but atleast try to offer something more to your guests - there was only BREAD BUTTER, EVERYDAY for breakfast. The tea/coffee dispenser was broken and we had to contact the receptionist lady (who wasn't the most friendly by the way) everytime to get any tea/coffee. (even the MILO cost 60 cents which should have been free. We told them to have something else for breakfast, but their excuse was that ""this is a hostel"". We ended up spending close to 40 dollars for 2 days for breakfast also.  5. WASHROOMS WERE SO BAD - enough said.   6. There is no lift - and don't expect any help with your luggage. we had to climb up 3 floors with our luggage.   7. There were no charging adapters given - and to top it off, they were selling it for 5 dollars knowing that guests will have to buy it.  DO NOT STAY HERE.   The only pro (though manageable somewhere else) is the location - it is centrally located.,…,Please save yourself some money by not going there because it's dirty, it smells like cat piss all over the 4th floor. Even when we changed room to the 3rd floor it smell bad. We decided to take our stuff and go elsewhere at 10h30 pm. Saving money sometimes isn't worthwhile!!!,Love the city love the food but the hotel was disappointing. Maybe its our first time to try a backpackers place so disillusioned with what to expect. But the location made up for its shortcomings. Met some friends made new ones too. Would definitely come back to sg but not the same place too bad. ,The place is cheap, yes. Got what I payed for, eh? But you hardly appreciate anything except for the free water.  Double deck beds are about to fall off (one ladder on our room did). Room scent smelled like 50 people were cramped in there on a scorching heat summer day with no ventilation or air conditioning. Shower has poor regulation of hot water, facilities mostly are broken. Got insect bites from bed, had to request atleast new covers, luckily they didn't charge me.   The place though is quite accessible. With bus & MRT stations on a walking distance. Wifi is available too on every floors.  Well a place like Singapore, the most expensive city to live in, one would say that this is fine. We got the rooms for about $25 a night per person. But there are better hostels around, and on my opinion, the owners have taken for granted this place.  P.S. This place doesn't offer free breakfast anymore.,…",,,,148,13,90
Betel Box Hostel,4.5,272 reviews,#27 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,Did a wonderful food tour sin and salvation with the owner Tony tang.a gastronomical adventure and an education in authentic chinese flavours aromas and tastes.The tour in Geylang district opened our eyes to other layers of singaporean society and several open secrets as well.Experience of a life time.Thanks a ton Tony.,Betel box has a both positive and negative factors The negative aspect is firstly the location is next to a bar and few vietnam pubs within the vicinity of the hostel.The pubs play loud music and can be noisy at times.This hostel does not give card access instead there is a passcode but they do have cctv as for the security aspect and a 24 hour receptionist that is handled by a very friendly man. There is no individual power source/socket for the individual dorms.The shower cubicle is very small.The hostel wifi is only strong near the main reception and quite weak near your bed. The hostel is a 15-20min walk from payar lebar mrt,We are a couple travelling for a lengthy period so we booked the family room in order to enjoy some privacy and extra space to spread out.  The room was very comfortable and clean, great natural light, quiet, and the air con was excellent.  The shared facilities - bathroom,  would benefit from a a simple renovation or repaint and thorough clean. Tony the owner and manager of the hostel, is a superb host. Very welcoming, enthusiastic and full of information but also prepared to spend the extra time with us creating an itinerary that matched our interests. Tony's restaurant recommendations locally and also in the centre of town were fantastic.  The location of the hostel is excellent. Close to the airport, in a fantastic interesting neighbourhood, great food outside the door, (try, the bean curd hotpot just down the street!!), the beach is a simple walk and a great place to enjoy a beer in the late afternoon !!  Thoroughly recommended if you are on a budget and want a more 'local' experience away from tall buildings and crowds of tourists..  Thanks Tony for your hospitality and also thanks to your offsider, Zim.,…,Other than the park close by, I wasn't much of a fan.  Wifi was TERRIBLE. They wont give you a discount for paying cash in person, even though it saves them money.  I didn't particularly like the location (a bit off from the middle of the city) and I couldn't find any food I really liked.  The lounge/kitchen was pretty nice.,I found this budget hostel at last minute for a my flight layover and it was well worth spending. 30mins from the airport by MRT or 40 mins by bus (SGD 2.4). The staff was very helpful and gentle explaining all info I need. He recommended me to visit the Joo Chiat area nearby with colorful local houses. The room was clean enough that meet basic needs. It also have area for exchanging books among travelers. Some minus points are no wifi in room, the mattress was too soft for me 😬😬 (I prefer the hard one), a little far from the center. Highly recommended for solo travelers.",Budget,,,98,15,93
Hotel Royal,3.0,898 reviews,#259 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,Great value for the room. The hotel room is big, spacious and has a big bathtub. The hotel staff were very helpful with any requests, they changed our room that was dirty. They also have a smart tv in the room to connect to netflix and youtube.,More than 12 times staying with hotel Royal. Big thank you to Mr Eric and Ms Alice for allocating a very good room for our staycation as always. Alice prepares everything in advance and ensure that I receive my breakfast coupon and parking coupon as well. She will also call in to my room to check if everything was okay. She is very meticulous and a very hardworking staff. Is our pleasure being serviced by Ms Alice. She process all the documents fast and promptly. Thanks for Ms Alice and Mr Eric, my family staycation has turned out well. We have also booked few more bookings for next year staycation too.   Price is very attractive for a 4* hotel , just 7 minutes walk to velocity mall, united square shopping mall, and novena square 2 . Hotel has ample parking space lot. Each room, has at least 30m2 in size, almost all rooms come with bathtub. Superior, deluxe, family room is between 30m2 to 33m2 in size. Great for families . The hotel do have connecting rooms too.   Many lights inside the room, so the room wont be too bright or too dark. Few sockets for you to charge your phones. The hotel has 3 lifts operating the 16 stories hotel building. If you want to refill your water, do so at the water dispenser machine just few steps away from the lift.   There is slipper provided in the room. The floor is carpeted floor, so that kids wont injure themselves if they fell down. The amenities includes body wash, shampoo, conditional, sanitizer, lotion. The television channels includes few abroad channels, as well as Malaysia NTV7 and NTV8 chinese tv program.   Breakfast is located at level 1. Can opt to dine in or request for takeaway. Each breakfast set includes main meal, usually is fried shrimp or fried fish or fried nuggets, plus fruit, plus mineral water, plus old coffee or tea or milo, plus salad kale, plus egg , sausages.,…,Easy access to Orchard with a bus stop directly in front of the hotel and to novena  shopping area.  The room is big but air con is not powerful enough,  we don't need blankets when sleeping.  The bathroom was old too, I think they did a semi renovation..hopefully can do more...bedsheets with holes which is not acceptable for all guests.   The pool was fine, only 1 hour usage.  I like the Chinese restaurant's food on the 2nd level...overall can have more improvement.,Booked a deluxe room with request of 1 large twin bed, when I checked in they said none available. They did managed to switch me to a family room instead which had twin bed only downside is it is at a lower floor. I also managed to check in an hour before the timing given. Room was tidy and neat when I entered. The best part of the room is definitely the bathtub, however it is only big enough for an average height like me (1.7m/5'7"") so keep in mind if you are taller. Wifi is decent, not super fast but good enough for streaming videos. I also would like to compliment the room service as I called to request some utensils and they delivered to me in under 5 mins, so do call them if you need some! (see pic below). Thanks to all hotel employees for a pleasant stay.,Booked the hotel to get some work done in a quite place.  1. Queued 1 hour and 15 min just to check in !  2. Wanted to do some work but this was impossible. After spending 45 min to get a WiFi connection, the connection kept dropping aver 5 min. To make the situation even worse, the 4G reception in the room was 1 bar so I could not even pair my laptop to the phone 4G plan.  Since it was clear that I would be unable to be productive, I decided to go out for dinner and then checked out around 11 pm.   In addition, the hotel was completely lacking in basic COVID preventive measures. Except for the lobby, there was no sanitizer provided in the lift or the other lift lobbies, nor in the rooms.  In the lobby there was a contact tracing book we’re visitors were requested to log in and, asked to provide personal details including name, address, hp number and full NRIC number - in violation of the PDPA, these details were visible to anybody registering and could easily be photographed if someone wanted to get a hold of personal identities.

Superb Hostel,3.0,47 reviews,#170 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Room was very small, no window, smell bad, leakage on the wall. 1 bunk bed but the lower bed had been dismantled, so they put 2 matrasses on the floor. Thin bed sheet, sarong and a pillow for each. No desk, no tv, basically it was just a room with matrasses.   Bathroom was dirty and smelly, no free drinking water, no common room, no pantry.  When I entered the room, the AC and fan were already on high speed, but it didn't help to get rid off the smell and the dampness of the room.   You pay $S3 if you want to store your luggage after check-out. Basically, you must pay any other service.   I immediately checked-out in the evening after booking another hotel.  Just stay out of this place.   ,The Superb is a budget hostel, which is well-located - right opposite the Sultan Mosque. Bugis train station is 350m and you can walk to Little India or the Marina. A Starbucks is also closely located and so is Tolido’s Espresso Nook, which has Singapore’s best breakfast. Biryani eateries are just across the road.   The rooms are narrow. We had a bunk bed  and one person needed to be on the upper bed, so the other one could sit on the lower bed in order to open the suitcase on the floor. Beds are squeaky - you wake up the entire floor trying to change sides. Let’s not talk about the mattress. The first call for prayer at the mosque is around 5am - it’ll be loud, don’t get startled.  The bathroom/shower situation is strange. You walk into an opening (no door shields it from the, corridor), and there are 3 tiny shower cubicles, and at the rear is the best bathroom of the establishment: a separate room with toilet, sink, shower head. So naturally, everyone tries to get into that one. The other 2 toilets, which are by the staircase, have a not-so-private way of closing doors: you walk through one loo into the next. While you can close this one, someone else might be outside using the second loo. It’ll surely make you laugh - at least out of desperation. Cleanliness of the bathrooms depends on the time you use them. I’ve seen them “sparkling”, but also very nasty. However, regardless of the time, they will always - ALWAYS - be so wet as if it was a swimming pool (once you’ve overcome your disgust, you’ll get used to it).  While I understand that Singapore is expensive, the moneymaking schemes of this institution are beyond shady. Check-in is 14:00 and while booking I selected our arrival time at 12:00. But we came at 13:30. Yet the charge of 20SGD was due (1 hr/10SGD). Nowhere did it say that while booking.   A friend came to show us around. He went to the reception to inquire about us and was told to wait outside. He asked whether he could wait in the reception room due to the A/C but was denied. It was another receptionist than the one we had checked-in with (he had been kind).  Recommendation? If you want a bed only, they provide that. Your hygiene routine will definitely be put on a hold. ,…,Its only S$110 a room for 4 people (actually its only for 3 people, but the owner allowed us to fill it with 4 peeps), free mineral water, clean room, no bed bugs, super friendly owner. I got a room which is separated with another building. And the building where i am in has no bathroom. So whenever I wanna use bathroom, I have to go to another building of motel.   Since I arrived at bugis street at midnight and there was no room available, and Superb Motel was the last choice for me & my friends.,I stayed in a two bed private room. It was very small, with just the beds, a table, a stool and some hooks.  The room also had air conditioning, which was needed.  There were no windows in the room.   The shower area was good. Very clean and spacious shower cubicles.   I did unfortunately see a few bugs in a few places, such as one of the bathrooms and in the bedroom.   The staff were very friendly.   The best thing about this hostel is its location. It is a short walk from the city centre, and marina bay. It is also a 5 minute walk away from the train station, which is very useful if you are going to or coming from the airport.   It is also near many restaurants, including a cheap food court in a shopping mall which is a five minute walk away.   Overall, this is a very good, place to stay.,…,I'm very happy stay in this hostel with my family and i think this is the best choice for backpacker also.. The price is not expensive and the facilities not bad And for the first i come to this hostel the staff very friendly and helpful especially for ""Ellen"".

The location provides ease of access to the city and you will find all that you need   within walking distance.

Everything about hotel is maximum 2 star except for customer service. The people at front desk put their max effort. Other than that, rooms are quite small and so is the washroom. Bed is rock hard but clean and AC is good. Room had slight cigarette smell as if someone smoked there few days ago although they are smoke-free.

Phil Inn,3.0,57 reviews,#224 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,I booked for a AC ROOM by paying the room charge upfront. When I checked-in with my family which included old age people, the receptionist/owner explained to us saying that there were no AC rooms available and he would instead give us a room with two extra beds. To be noted - There were no fans in the room and neither lights. It was a dark room with no air. When we questioned him regarding we had booked months prior and we would not be able to stay in a place like that, he was not polite at all. It was almost 10 pm when we checked in and hence we couldn't find any other way. For questioning him, he was very rude and asked us to get out of the place and said he will return our money. He placed one pedestrial fan and expected us to keep our doors open for fresh air. Totally a bad, experience on the first day at Singapore.,…,I gave Phil Inn high marks for my month there in January, but my return for 2 weeks May/June is the absolute worst hostel of the dozens I've stayed in: bed bugs, cockroaches, boss doesn't pay employees so they quit, remainder made to work 24 hrs, till family gets them to quit, so no housekeeping, When I came to check in, no employee so had to wait outside in tropical heat for 3 hours until girl who had quit came to help. Refused to change mattresses with bed bugs, guest took video of bedbug walking on the bedding,  Wifi very intermittent. Air conditioning is excellent, and plenty hot water in shower, how and why did it get so bad?!,The rooms were clean: we took two private rooms with 6 beds as we were travelling with families and friends. The room on the ground floor was less convenient as it smelled moisture. But we spent two nights there without any issue with the wifi working fine also.,THE PEOPLE STAYING IN THE HOSTEL, are NOT TRAVELLERS, IS PEOPLE LIVING THERE.. SO NO BACKPACKERS ATMOSPHERE AT ALL. In our room everybody was around 40-50 years old males. So as a Girl I didnt feel comfortable at all. Rooms very small (8 people dorm). Small lockers. Toilet not very clean. Airco... they put it at 18degrees and we changed it to 23 but the guys living there change it at 18 again.  STAFF very RUDE. I came in the evening and I went to the toilet of my room, and there was no toilet paper (and I still didnt use the toilet in all the day). I went back to the recepction and I asked for some toilet paper and he just said:  "" there is no cleaning lady until tomorrow morning""  And he did NO effort to get any paper for me, so I went to the toilet without being able to use, paper. I didnt even shower in this hostel, I changed next day and use another hostels shower.,…,Great location - very close to Rochor MRT, next door to a popular local restaurant.The staff are helpful and professional. We stayed 1 night in a mixed dorm. All the rooms have an ensuite bathroom. Our bathroom could've been cleaner but the water pressure was great.

Orange Grove Serviced Residences,3.0,130 reviews,#166 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,This service apartment is affordable for medium budgeted vaccation in Singapore. Only drawback is the subway is not close, hence have to depend on Uber services. The housekeeping is every alternate day hence you have to keep you place clean by yourself. The cooking facility is enough to make your meals.,We stayed there for 6 nights...good location...peaceful... walkable distance to the main Street and bus station...was a nice living room and bedroom combo...suitable for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids...kitchen facilities available..nice swimming pool,It was fine. That´s place in Singapore just for night sleeps, because you want to explore Singapore. If you are hotel type- this hotel not for you. One of the minuses is that at the hall there were ants.,We picked Orange Grove Serviced Apartments because we wanted a clean quiet place in this busy metropolis to stay for at least 2 weeks.  We also wanted to have the ability to prepare a simple meal like salad with some protein so we needed a good working kitchenette.  Location: is great as it is closer to Orchard Road rather than Stevens Road. It's no more than 10 mins walk.  There is also a supermarket, Cold Storage located in the Orchard Hotel building on Claymore Road entrance.  Reception: cooled by a big noisy fan. While I support lowering greenhouse emission, I think having the air-con in the afternoon for about 4 hours when the sunlight comes through the glass panels behind the reception desk is not an unreasonable expectation.  Room:  Room servicing was erratic and not well, scheduled e.g. no service for 8 days then a service with a 4 days gap. Air-conditioners were dripping water on the floor creating a slip & fall hazard.   Kitchenette: good size working fridge; bare minimum crockery and cutlery with well-used pots & pan that could be refreshed. No container for wet or dry kitchen waste provided.  Laundry: I checked out the washing machines and decided against using them from a public health point of view.  Staff: They were helpful. They tried to provide services to the guest the best that they could. I can see the limitation is not the staff but the system the management team has put in place making it an uphill battle for staff to provide a good standard of customer service.   Maintenance: When we were there, the roof in the hallway suffered water ingress and a staff member trying to mop up the pool of rainwater. This is another indication the management team is focused on cost rather than quality.  My observations suggest that the improvement needed for this place lies with the systems put in place by the management team.,…,My son, daughter-in-law and myself were booked to stay 4 nights in these apartments, we arrived late at night, the rooms were disgustingly dirty, handprints on walls fat spilt on the floor, the shower/bath leaked all over the floor, the tables had marks from cups and food, overall it was revolting.

When we arrived we thought the staff was a bit rude because they didn't really acknowledge us but when we checked out they were friendly and helpful so maybe it was the language barrier. The rooms are basic and for the cheap price doable. We think it should have a big clean-up and some renovation in an ideal world, but for us it was fine for the night we stayed.

Q Loft,3.5,8 reviews,#162 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Ultimately if your paying under 50sgd in Singapore for a double room with basic breakfast, AC etc you can't expect much. This place was functional and met my needs for 1 night. It's not in the best of area's,  but not that should bother you, with loads of cheap places to eat on your doorstep. It's a short walk to Paya Lebar MRT station and buses stop virtually outside. The room was as I expected,  basic but clean. A small but comfy double bed, private WC and shower, TV, AC that worked really well,  free bottled water, towels,  toiletries,  etc. There is a shared kitchen area which you can use which is where you have breakfast which was basic bread, jam and tea, coffee.  The hotel was difficult to find because it's above shops and restaurants and only a single door frontage that, I initially missed. It's on Geylang about 10 m from the corner of Lor 34 between the Chinese restaurant and a 7/11 type store. I arrived early and as expected my room was not available,  so I left my bags which had been put in my room ready when I returned later. Staff were very polite. So that's about it, as cheap as a hostel but a lot more for your money. ,…,Our room was so small that we barely had any room to move in.  Double bed, not queen, bedding not big enough to cover 2 people.  It was SO noisy.  Truck, car and scooter noise non stop and people laughing downstairs at the bars.  Nice to be close to China Town, but wouldn’t stay here again,  Very expensive for what you get.  Definitely should be ranked as a budget hotel.,I jus spend I day in Singapur for Business and I stay in this beautiful hotel in the Chinatown 20 min from the airport. It’s very clean and the breakfast is included. By night you can come into the lobby bar and listen live music and why no drink Corona.. ,This place has very, very good customer service which i must first commend in the first sentence of this review. I was there for 3 days and two nights and there was the same staff throughout my stay, day and night. But he was friendly, helpful and jovian. It actually seemed like he was the one who did absolutely everything in the hotel.   Be aware that this hotel IS in the red light district of Singapore.  My room was a single bed room, and the only single bed room in the already small hotel. It was unfortunately crawling with ants along the wall, a tile or two had chipped or fell off. The wall hiding behind the toilet door wasn't to die for either, the room didn't feel complete, but it was livable.   I did get the opportunity to go into the other rooms, the double bed room and, family room. Those were definitely more decent, they felt cleaner and were better maintained. They even had a cosy feel to them.   It comes with breakfast in the vicinity's small kitchen. Don't expect a wide spread or a 4 star hotel breakfast, but it was pretty decent for it's standard. Bread, a fruit, protein (eggs, tuna or others), rice or porridge.   There are plenty of food around the area, hawkers mostly. But there are three mrt stations within walking distance, and Paya Lebar Square is about 900m (12 - 18min walk) from the hotel.   In all, it isn't a place for fussy stayers. But if you're pretty easy going, don't want to pay premium prices for an accommodation and get your own room and toilet, then one can definitely consider this place. ,…,Q Loft Hotel provided best services for their customers. Friendly and helpful receptionist . Environment at the surrounding was peaceful, strategic location where restaurants, convenient shops are within walking distance. Will stay again as it provided reasonable price for staying and good facilities as well. ",,,,54,7,75

The two bedroom apartment was very nice but there is no amenities. Rooms are clean. The place is located in a good location where you have got lot of food outlets nearby in walking distance. Beds are comfortable. Staffs are very good.,The place is actually good for gathering as it is spacious and cooling with 4 air conditioner. However, theres only 1 controller so if at night you need to adjust the temp u have to share it with another roommate. The toiletries are only soap n shampoo without toothbrush which is a disappointment. The place doesnt have oven/microwave. Overall, the chalet offer limited amenities as well as check out can take up to half an hour as they have to come and do spot check first b4 u claim yr deposit at the lobby.,We checked in to this place to celebrate a family members' birthday. I booked a 2 bedroom suite. The hall and balcony is very spacious. Its a good place to have a private celebration (small crowd). The rooms and toilets were clean.  However, there were no utensils and microwave oven in this place. Its a bit surprising that the room comes with a kitchen yet without the basic inventory. The swimming pool is decent and has a few facilities which will keep you occupied. Having Wild Wild Wet next door is definitely an advantage.,I stayed here overnight for a small family celebration (3 persons).  The executive suite was about the size of a HDB 5 room flat; big and spacious hall, big master bedroom (queen-size bed) and smaller bedroom (two single-sized beds).  They had a LCD TV (about 40 inch) that provided local channels. There is also a fish/prawning facility downstairs where you can try your luck for fishing.  Interested parties should take note that you can only engage the official caterer there (Ban Heng Restaurant). Food at the restaurant is good though!  In all, if all you need is a good cosy accomodation for a night or two for a few persons, the Aranda Country Club executive suites is a good option. Prices differ for Aranda Counry Club Members, Union members and public.  Will recommend this site, as an option, if you have the budget to choose a place that is less noisy compared to other sites.,…",,,,54,5,91

The price is quite expensive for a hotel with a very standard service. The room is very small and it's located a bit far from the MRT station. Although, the good thing is the friendly staff & helpful.,Checked in this afternoon 2nd July for a short stay. Felt so welcoming for me & my partner by a malay lady officer today and these made me to do a feedback. Very nice & polite officer. Frequent visit to this hotel just for a short stay but was not even given to this basic service before this.,For two consecutive years, we stayed at this hotel and we find it so easy to roam around Singapore. Easy access to the train station going to places and shopping spot in SG! Looking forward for another stay!,Terrible service, i cannot rate it even at 1 out of 5. The reception was not friendly nor the buffet. All were treating us as if we are there for a burglary. Food is ridiculous too. Rooms were too small having no space to get on bed even. We got an amusing 3 in one liquid for soap shampoo and handwash.,The hotel has amazing staffs! Very accomodating and always have smiles on their faces. The breakfast is amazing!

Hotel Fuji,4.0,8 reviews,#20 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,For Singapore, offered great value for money for a simple but clean hotel. Yes, the location is regarded as the red-light district, but we had no issues as the neighbourhood was quiet and safe. MRT (metro) is a good 10 to 15 minute walk depending on the station, bus stops are closer. Nevertheless, an ideal location for exploring the city and access to Changi airport for those on a budget. There are no lifts in the hotel, we were travelling light with no luggage, so was not a problem. I would stay there again without a doubt.,Well,  I have so much to say about this hotel, but firstly it is the right place which I would never ever go back or booking again.  They gave me the room at the ground floor in which i found they rent rooms to prostitutes and clients. The bathroom was wetty and water was spread over all the corners of the bathroom and I had the impression that they rent the room for some prostitute right before I checked in. Also there were a bad small  I asked to the guy at the counter to come and change the room but I could see that he did not care and he refused to change me the room.  The staff were everything apart from being of being friendly, kind and self motivated.  In the morning I saw insects on my room as well.,We stay here for our company trip to Singapore. It is quite far from MRT station, which is around 2KM walking distance. There is no lift in this hotel and we have to take the staircase to go to the upstairs room. The toilet is quite small but it has a very unique semi transparent toilet door. The room is clean and not much issue but is just that, the aircond in all the room is not that cool. Everything is fine as we stay here for 1 night only and we just come back to hotel for 1 night sleep. ,We had a great little stay in this hotel while we visited Singapore. The price was just right for the location which was easy to get to and from the airport and marina bay using the trains. Our room was the perfect size for the two of us and had a very comfortable bed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit!,We managed to book the room here for the very last minute. Even though, Geylang is like Singapore's red light district I found it really quiet, peaceful and had a decent stay here.  Yes it's located on a far way corner of Jl. Molek but we didnt mind. It's still close to nearby bus stop and 10-11 minute walk to Aljuneid MRT Station. Mini market are all available nearby with affordable price compared to minimarket in Orchard and Clarke Quay area.  We got a pretty spacious room, it was quite, air conditioner worked really well too. Bathroom is kinda small but thats ok. there are towels, shower with warm water and we managed to sleep well at night. The internet wi-fi worked really fast too.

Toilets are clean.,Stayed here for almost a week. Chose it based on the location, it is right next to boat quay. Good for backpackers, but don't expect bells and whistles. Surrounded by lots of nice places to eat and drink and you can explore central areas on foot.  The bathrooms were extremely clean.  Not enough storage space if you have luggage - and people had basically left their suitcases in the corners.,Checking-in and checking-out was easy. Location was near Clarke Quay MRT station, Boat Quay, and if you walk further down you are able to reach Raffles Place and Chinatown. Bathroom and capsules were average. Would recommend to stay for a couple of nights but not for several days or weeks. The only complaint that I have is the noise made by other travelers staying there. There was a family staying there throughout my stay there and they did not respect the quiet hours. Some even talked over the phone for almost an hour. Would suggest to provide ear plugs or bring your own.,Oil and he really said replace a clean place with washing possibility. More of a backpacker place.okay for some nights but not for several weeks- no possibility to lick big suitcases- only little things. Keep that in mind when you book!  No breakfast possibility- but a Starbucks close by (Not that cheap....) And you not leave anything on the floor when you’re sleeping in that hostel - things are removed- put into the washing room :-p,I stayed here for 2 nights in September for a brief work trip. My budget was limited so I chose to stay in a capsule instead of a hotel after great experiences in Japan using capsule hotels.   Wanderloft capsule Hotel wasn’t bad at all for a cheaper option in expensive Singapore. Bathrooms and capsules are basic, but clean and practical. It offers more privacy then a hostel, but is quite similar.   The location was fantastic, right in boat quay. So lots of places to eat and drink close by and even Chinatown is only 10 minutes walk alway.   Cheers,   Ben",,4782,ZenHotels.com,723,107,100

The beds were comfy, staff friendly and the free breakfast was nice.  I was in a dorm of 10 people, normally I prefer 4/6 bed dorms but the room was spacious and quiet at night so there were no problems  Recommend staying here ,had been there during the last week of Dec-2019 with family. We got the family room(with 8 beds and private bath). All beds are bunker beds. Would be ideal for youngsters.This place is on the 1st floor with no lift. If you have elders/senior citizens, I would not recommend this place. Else, it is worth the budget. They have free breakfast(bread, cereals and cut fruit), it is the same everyday. The have a common cafeteria, with a microwave and bread toaster. Place is quite cramped.,女性専用ドミトリールーム（6人部屋）を利用しました。 2段ベッドの下には大きな鍵付きロッカーがあり、荷物をぼんぼん入れられます。 また、バスタオル1枚付いていて助かりました。 室内に専用シャワー＆トイレもあり快適です。  ただ、道路に面した部屋なため騒音が気になる方は合わないと思います。 朝食は7:30からで、パン、シリアル、コーヒー、紅茶、オレンジがフリーで食べれます。  空港からでしたらRochor駅の方が便利でした。,No backpacker vibe when we were there, which made the communal rooms feel quite anonymous. Two person bunk bed was nice. Room for backpacks beside the bed. Locker underneath allowed two soft handluggage sixed backs to be safely stored.   Good hawker center nearby with great Ghee Dosa which we craved for after Sri Lanka. Breakfast is ok, especially for a small bite as you’ll be eating all day in singapore (includes fresh oranges).  Location is good for exploring all the way up to Marina Bay on foot. Otherwise the hostel is conveniently located between two main MRT subway lines.",,,,258,46,100

First, BECAUSE OF THE BEDBUGS, UNTIL WE STILL HAVE THE MARKS ESPECIALLY ON OUR LEGS. Secondly, they dont clean the rooms everyday, its so messy. Third, everyday, they transferred you to different rooms, so you have to packed up your things, so hassle. Fourth, BREAKFAST IS ALWAYS THE SAME, BREAD, EGG, PEANUT BUTTER OR BUTTER. DEFINITELY, WE DIDNT ENJOY OUR STAY HERE! IT WAS A DISASTER! THE PICTURES AS SHOWN WERE NOT REAL.,Good service, very affordable room rates, clean rooms and bathrooms. When you are on a tight budget and not so picky about your accommodation, i recommend this place to stay.,Staff was really helpful! I even got a free ticket to River Safari from one of the receptionists :). Dorm was comfortable and every bed had curtains so, it was good to have some privacy.

Raffles Marina Hotel,3.5,24 reviews,#152 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,We booked 2 rooms Fishing Staycation promo under Traveloka. Check In process was smooth, hassle free. Staff was nice.   Room is pretty spacious and I wish they had bathtub. If only the balcony were facing the sea, I think that will be good but the garden view was fine for me too.  During checked in process, we were informed that the isn't any halal food around so we had to pass the breakfast. Grab/Foodpanda choices was kind of limited as well.   Fishing by the breakwater requires permit. There wasn't any catch of the day due to low tide.   Overall, 2D1N was just a decent stay.,Booked the Fishing Staycation after hearing from a dear friend. Emails were promptly replied by Suzie and Cindy and booking was done very swiftly. Check-in by Suzie was fast and she was detailed in explaining to us important information pertaining to the available facilities and covid measures.   Room was bright, of a good size and well maintained. Our room had access to small partially landscaped lawn via full glass sliding doors for fresh air n vast view. Shower area (in our room) seemed to have been refurbished.   Fishing at the breakwaters was relaxing and the weekday afternoon there were numerous ‘regulars’ and families with kids. The place was well-kept and had a different charm at night. Catch of the day - catfish, flower crab, parrot fish, saw the archer fishes ‘at work’, too. We kept the parrot fish and flower crab for dinner. Tackle shop within property had live baits for sale (do check its operation hours though). Numerous catfishes, a sea bass and a garoupa from night fishing on the first night. All were released. Second night catches were 3 garoupas , catfishes and a few glass fishes.   Had dinner at Captain’s Table on the first night. Service was excellent, Susan and Siew Peng were attentive and friendly. Variety from the menu was good with many popular Chinese dishes. Portions were also substantial. Although we requested for the fish and flower crab to be steamed ‘in a simple manner’, we appreciated the Chef’s creativity and efforts in whipping up 2 additional dishes which were done beautifully, well-garnished and so yummy!   Breakfast served at Bistro was freshly made and adequate and place was not congested as like during lunch or dinner times. However, it doesn’t provide take-away services for redemption via vouchers (those issued to house guests). Dinner at Bistro was also enjoyable and they were doing brisk business as there were many external guests. David, Mohan and team were hardworking and attentive and were doing their best to serve all guests.   We also got to know Mr Jit from the Security Team during our stay. He was alert and very focused and has great observation skills. His service was also exceptional and was empathetic to offer us a wood stool and a mini parasol to shield us from the scorching sun at the breakwater.   Raffles Marina was suitable for us as it met what we were looking for, well maintained outdoor with spacious grounds, convenient spot for recreational fishing, sufficient F&B options and most of all the very spontaneous and helpful staff. We found this a good alternative for a relaxing short vacation without having to spend much time traveling to nearby countries to fish (which is not possible at present time anyway). It is truly a hidden gem!,…,Have not been for years. Went for lunch with biz partners and cooking is very average. Very crowded since not many places to eat in this part of Tuas and hence rather expensive for non members. Forgettable place...,We were a group of 11 diners for Team Lunch. It was my first time but not for others. First feelings - Big car parking space, awesome entry with pictures hanging against dimmed lights and spacious walking path and then being ushered onto the massive open space with a massive umbrella protecting us from sudden Singapore rains. As we had advance booking, we got a corner place, but that has nothing to do with quietness or calmness. Friday noise was all-pervading. Sitting down, I was soaking in the views of the yachts, the expansive Tuas waters and the buildings of JB (quite an eyesore) on the other side. Something different from the other restaurants of Singapore.  The Server came and handed us a iPad for ordering, didn't ever tried to start a conversation stating the day's special, or something like that. She came after sometime to verify the orders. The drinks came quick and then the soup, starters and main course. So, what's different - Nothing at all. Though the prices were near to gourmet variety, but the taste wasn't and the Indian dishes failed miserably to measure up to authenticity of the spices or the presentation. The Indian dishes seemed more like Hawker's market food served on nice cutlery and by uniformed servers. We tried ordering in more Nan but no one responded to our hand gestures for 5 minutes. So, someone walked to the main counter and ordered there. The waiters were all walking and running without even glancing at any of the nearby tables. I thought we might be assigned a dedicated server to take care of our needs considering our team size to be 11.  So let me rank - 1. Drinks - 4 out of 5 being fresh. 2. Soups - 3 out of 5 as the presentation was innovative being served inside a bread. 3.  Main Course - 2 out of 5. Lacked authenticity and flavor. 4. Quality of Service - 1.5 out of 5 - 1.5 is due to iPad (:-))  5. Ambience -  Calmness - 1 out of 5 (very noisy)                          Views        - 3.5 out of 5 (keep on watching the yachts)                           Entry and Exit Path - 4 out of 5 (due to old-world charm)  Shall I go there a 2nd time - Maybe during dinner time to have beers and have starters like Onion rings/fries; but not lunch time.,…,Last stayed here in 2004, it’s been refurbished a little bit.. bit dated.. it’s ok and fits our needs while we are here.

I particularly liked the hotel location as it is quiet and of a walkable distance to amenities and faber park. Vivo city is also nearby.  Thank you for the pleasant memories !,The room that I've gotten wasn't the same room in the pictures displayed. I don't know if it's because I checked in much later, like around 6pm?  Room is generally ok. The fridge wasn't very clean, it had dirty stains on it. The daikin aircon unit was really really very old and looked dirty. The aircon wasn't strong and cold. I was feeling warm at night with the aircon switched on at full blast, 5/5 fan speed and 18 degrees (which was the lowest allowed). The room only got cool after the TV was switched off when I went to bed and after I woke up in the morning. It's equivalent to a good aircon unit at 1/5 fan speed and at 25 degree. No joke.  Toilet is small (shower area, directly next to toilet bowl) but usable. It was sad that the chair at the dressing table was a mini chair, of about 30cm height. So it's really uncomfortable for any plus size to sit on it.   Only choose this room if you don't have high expectations and just only needed a place to crash. Decent enough if you have places that you want to visit nearby.   Vivo city mall is like a 10 mins bus ride away. Otherwise, there's no nearby amenities at the hotel. So you have to get everything at Vivo city mall.,…,The whole place needs an over haul.  Dirty rooms, What looks like alcohol thrown onto walls.

Aloha Changi,3.0,22 reviews,#303 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly),,"Share, ,My family and I booked the Fairy Point Bungalow 1B. First of all, the bungalow which was already quite small was divided into half. It is stated on the website in very small print, and it is not made clear to anyone booking on the website. There was only one bedroom for my family of four to share. The kitchen and the living room appear to be the same place, and there is a miserable little corner with a table.  I can only assume that they did not want customers to know that they changed the bungalow like this. And this seems to be the only bungalow that got separated into two, the others are all still in one piece. I feel that we were cheated of our money. This “bungalow” is ridiculously small. Definitely not worth $170 a night.  Furthermore, there was a huge lizard in the only, bedroom. Disgusting. The bedroom is tiny, with barely any space to walk.   There is a sliding door at the front of the house. There are no curtains or blinds in front of it, and anyone outside can look in at us. The wooden door is broken too.  The aircon was awful. It is way too hot in this house and they make us pay if we exceed a certain amount of units given to us for the aircon.  The people in Bungalow 1A can see us and we can see them through the windows, considering this place was built to be ONE house.  In conclusion, I would not recommend staying here. This bungalow is a lot smaller than my own house, it is filthy, and there is no sense of privacy.,…,Stayed in Fairy Point Chalet 1 and the exclusive location met my needs of having a large group get-together.  The rental fee per day has somewhat becomes more exorbitant and that could put off the premise as an option. But as I have said - for a large group get-together (say 80 pax) for a buffet dinner, there is not many places that brings the traditional ""colonial"" feel like this property.   After more than a decade from booking such properties (the usual ones from Loyang Change), I do observed improvements made to make the stay more comfortable. However, that is as much as I could say for traditional processes like handing and taking over of inventory still exists. The wooden furniture while bringing back a nostalgic feel also gives an impression that they might give way, anytime. The sofa and beds are too low for comfort - especially to the elderly.   Conclusion: Changi chalets or bungalows still provide an option for large group get-together. It might be timely for the management to focus on how to improve the traditional processes now that renovation to the properties had more or less been completed.,…,Book 2 night of garden chalet “I” for my Daughter 1st birthday.  From outside, it looks creepy.  Inside was not well maintain and full of lizards and ants and mosquitoes.1st night itself, I had destroy 4 lizards.  The entrance to the chalet was a high slope and had problem turning in.  The place was so humid that we had to stay in the room before the party start.   Overall experience, is Super bad. Not recommended and is not cheap either. ,Organised a family get together at the chalet and had a BBQ in the evening. Generally the place was clean and had the basic plates , pots and pans for simple cooking. Be aware that there is only one car lot per chalet and so guests will have to find alternate car parks nearby. The check out time is also super early. Someone will be at your door about 9.30am to stock check. So you have to be packed and out by then.,Had a good time with a BBQ party with lots of friends. Simple place, but clean and nice. Full kitchen was good. Quite isolated so no complaints about our loud music.  We had an unfortunate event where we broke a kitchen appliance and had to pay a substantial damages bill.

Backpackers Inn Chinatown,3.0,233 reviews,#151 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,We stayed in a private room and with shared bathroom. Bathrooms are clean despite it being shared. Shampoo and shower creams were provided.   Water heater and sachets of coffee and tea was provided in the room but we didn’t get any refills for the coffees and teas (it would’ve been nicer if we did).   Clean linen and towels when we came in. That was a plus point. Tv was provided as well but don’t expect to watch any channels cause apparently there isn’t any and that the tv was for display only.   Breakfast was provided. In my opinion, the breakfast spread was decent and as expected.   On the other hand, it definitely is not the place to stay if you have little children or if you are a light sleeper cause it can be really noisy at night cause of the pubs and bars around.   Free, wifi is available. Very near to Chinatown MRT and People’s park. A handful of 7 Elevens around for some late night snacking. McDonalds is also just around the corner.  I’ve stayed here twice this year, the facilities are sufficient enough for me. ,…,Good location, close to lots of bars and restaurants in Chinatown. Really close to Chinatown MRT station and walking distance (20-30 mins) to gardens by the bay, marina bay and downtown etc.  Hotel itself is good for the price, the room we had was small but it was a really good use of space (the double bunk bed type thing above a living space with a sofa and kettle etc). Air con was a life saver in Singapore heat!   Room was a little tired, stains on the wall and a small patch of damp behind the sofa. Also there was a funny smell, which didn’t go away at all during our stay, I think is due to lack of air - the window does not open and as the room is so small I guess with 2 people staying in it it builds up a bit of a smell. But, good for the price. I probably wouldn’t stay again, however (due to the smell), though I would maybe try the Galaxy Pods next door which is owned by the same people. The hotel was full (Singapore GP weekend) so I didn’t ask for another room as they wouldn’t have been able to give us one. We walked past one of the other double rooms (bigger without the bunk bed thing) and it looked a bit more modern so my advice would be book one of those!  Communal areas were clean but a little tired, one of the sliding bathroom doors was a little temperamental but I made sure I used the other one. Washing and drying facilities for clothes available. Breakfast basic but fine given it is free, good to have a cuppa and some Kaya toast in the morning.,…,Nice located Hostel in good part of Chinatown district, close to MRT station and crowd part of touristic Chinatown. Rooms was small, but nice and clean. Airconditioner works well. Hotel offer basic breakfast.  Helpful personel.

After seeing room walking up a flight of steps below code, I went into room noticed AC was not working properly and TV had ""no signal"", saw the bathroom area, which looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months, I immediately went on a nearby search for another place to stay.  I came back within an hour telling a new crew that I wanted my reservation cancelled.  Staff came up and got ac working and switched a box of some sort to only see movies or TV shows, I attempted to make it work BUT after trying to see the same movie 2 separate times since it just stopped working,  I was done. Gave me a partial refund.  Beware of this place, its dreadful!!,I stayed in this inn before. After they had renovatation I wanna see what it looks like. They have 10 rooms so the room is bigger. Luggage can put under the bed. With kettle and cup, tea bag, coffee, bottle water in room, they are free.  Free wifi, a big monitor for tv with lot of channels and online facilities. The mattress is comfortable, pillow and cusion as well. I like blue room. The ligting is soft, side table and dresser table are also available. So you can imagine how big is the room. Hair dryer, iron, washing machine and dryer is available in public area. Aircon is quiet, bedding is comfortable. They has made a big change to the inn. The location is good, close to MRT. It is worth to stay, pay in low price but enjoy great stay.","Centrally Located,Budget",,,870,127,100
Rucksack Inn @ Lavender,4.5,471 reviews,#26 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Filipino","Share, ,I found Rucksack Inn by accident through browsing online, and I'm glad I did! I'm sure Rucksack Inn is one of the best backpacker hostels in Singapore. I stayed at the one in Lavender Street (If you take the MRT, alight at Boon Keng station). True, if you travel from Changi airport, the location is a bit far-off, but it's actually only a few stops to Vivo City which is this big, new and very nice shopping mall - if you want to go to Universal Studios, you take a train from this Vivo City.  Anyway what I like even from the booking process is that I didn't have to book through a hostel booking website. I only had to send an e-mail, and one of the friendly Rucksack staff replied with a confirmation e-mail, and that's it! Very handy if you don't own a credit card like me. I, corresponded through e-mail a few times, including in the morning of my flight to let the staff know I was definitely coming, and each time the staff responded very friendly - especially ED. I felt as if I had a friend waiting for me, and that's very nice if you travel alone.  Upon arriving at the place, I was impressed with how it looks like. The lobby/common area is nice and cozy, and at the room smelled nicely of lemongrass. Super nice! The facilities are good too; each traveler has access to a big locker, which you can use to keep even a big luggage. Each bed is equipped with a comforter, a reading light and electricity socket - all very handy. The showers have hot and cold water, shampoo and shower gel. There are also washing machines, and ironing board, hairdryer for women, sinks and mirror. I heard there's another hostel with good reputation but the washing-up sink is near the dining area, which makes it awkward when you're brushing your teeth. But here at Rucksack, you don't have to worry about that.  Then there's also free Wi-Fi and Mac computers with internet access, and a cozy reading corner (when I say cozy, I really mean this!) with books to keep you company. Of course you can always watch the TV provided in the lobby/common area and I think there's also a weekly movie night. In the kitchen/pantry there's a refrigerator if you'd like to keep any food for later, as well as unlimited coffee, tea, bread and jam, and also drinking water. If you don't bring cutlery, you can also borrow them here.   Another plus point is that we get an access card which we have to use to enter the building, which makes it more secure as only guests can enter. And if you're used to staying at hotels where you get a wake-up call to catch a morning flight, you can request that here - I did! I had to check-out at 6.  Bear in mind I never stayed at a backpacker hostel before, so I was initially a bit worried about sleeping in a bunkbed with strangers in the room. But the staff and fellow travelers are all nice, and the place made me feel comfortable and safe. If I sound like I cannot stop raving about Rucksack, it's because I can't. I was truly impressed and I'm sure staying at Rucksack was what made my trip more enjoyable. I hope more people get to have the positive experience I did here. If I need to stay at a backpacker hostel in Singapore again, Rucksack will definitely be my first choice.,…,We stayed for one night and payed 24 SD which was a little more than usual because we checked in on a Friday. For that we got a dorm bed, free all day breakfast consisting of jam, butter, peanut butter and toast, free hot and cold drinks, clean showers and toilets, computers and fast wifi, laundry service, very friendly and helpful staff that are more than ready to give you useful advice for your stay in Singapore etc. and I can just say that we really liked it there :),This place maybe far from the airport, but still easily reached through MRT. The staffs are friendly, and the facilities are good (TV, small library, internet, laundry, private lamp, hair dryer, stand washer). The most useful is the unlimited toast. I can eat anytime! So no need for me to buy more snack from outside. Everytime i am hungry, i just make one... or two... or more.  Then when i am too tired because of walking too much, i can lay down on the comfortable couch provided. They provide the rent of bicycle and sell some stuffs for shower as well. The place is clean, i like it.,If I go to Singapore again, I will surely choose Rucksack inn as this is a very clean and nice hostel to stay. And you only take a bus to go to the famous place such as Marina bay, China town... Just want to say thanks to the staffs for their kindness. Hope someday I could go there again,I traveled on my own to Singapore, hoping to meet great people at the hostel. And that was the case. Check-in at 2am was no problem, I had some difficulties to find my room but some friendly other guests helped me finding it. Next morning the ‘offical’ check in. Room and bathroom was clean and the breakfast was ok for the price. Nothing special but the food at Singapore’s food centers is pretty good and cheap. The rooftop was a chill out area. But the furniture was a bit poor and old. That should be fixed. Besides, we played card games, listend to music and drank a few beers together. All together I would recommend this place for solo travelers, as well as for couples and friends. I would stay there another time.",Budget,,,134,20,89

Louis Kienne Serviced Residences - Havelock,4.5,589 reviews,#24 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Car park,"English, Arabic, Filipino, Hindi","Share, ,I stayed at Louis Kinne for 11 months. Great apartments. Very clean as rooms cleaned twice a week. Very friendly staff who looked after me and were very attentive. Going above and beyond for my Birthday. Great location near Great World City and many bus routes. Rooftop pool with views.,Due to Covid 19 breakfast was delivered to the room. However it was delivered at 9.00am or later . As I was working this was useless.  The couch in the lounge was also a bed. It was an extremely uncomfortable seat to sit it. ,Stayed for 6 nights.   Pros: location was good.  Cons: room was dusty, towels smell bad, rusty kettle, damaged iron tip, no free parking, no standard amenities in room example toothbrush. Housekeeping quality is lacking, you can request for a change of bedsheet and housekeeping really change only the bedsheet despite seeing the rubbish bin full to the brim in room but choose to ignored it.   Summary: This is a service apartment that does not have all the service qualities of a service apartment. Only spend your money here if you are after the location or if you are not fussy about cleanliness or service. ,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our  stay at Louis Kienne Havelock. Special thanks to our chambermaid Kim (Hakim before her) for her diligence and dedication. Front desk Jeremy, Alvin and Sha for their patience and thoughtful service. Friendly engineer for prompt response to any small repairs needed. Cheerful aunties at breakfast before the CB who brought a home kitchen feel to the place. Management staff were all focused and esp GM Sharon who was always looking out for guests' welfare. Overall, excellent team and I would highly recommend Louis Kienne Havelock.,Overall a good stay, front desk willing to assist with any queries. Rooms were spacious and housekeeping was good. Could benefit from minor tidy-ups e.g painting the rooms but otherwise no real issues.","Modern,Family",,,83,12,82
Park Avenue Rochester Hotel,4.0,"1,014 reviews",#81 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,I was required to serve a 14-day SHN at a designated facility to comply with the Singaporean governments Covid-19 regulations - I am truly blessed that this was at a hotel as luxurious and well-equipped as the Park Avenue Rochester.   From the moment I set foot in the building, the staff were attentive, courteous and very accommodating. I was given a hot meal upon arrival and could choose from an extensive choice of different world cuisines, provided by Cali Cafe. The check-in procedure was well regimented - ensuring I felt safe, secure and fully informed.  Throughout my stay, the aforementioned cuisine could be changed regularly upon request. The three daily meals were substantial, varied and mostly served hot. In addition, my room included a microwave oven which could be used, to warm up dishes and cook ready-meals. All external delivery services would be collected and delivered immediately by reception staff - I was able to utilise Deliveroo, Foodpanda and Amazon frequently. They also kindly collected and promptly delivered an exercise bike to my bedroom from local company HappySHN.   The amenities in the suite were exceptional - I was provided a fridge-freezer, washing machine, sofa, bathtub and shower. Most impressively, the 22nd floor apartment also offered sublime views over the Buona Vista and the NTU complex. The décor was clean and modern - having such comfortable surroundings made it feel more like a holiday than a mandatory quarantine.  Fresh linen and towels were provided frequently and any requests for toiletries were always quickly answered.  The WiFi was provided without any additional surcharge and allowed me to stay on Skype with my partner 24:7. I was also able to stream videos, check emails and work effectively without disconnection. Two large digital televisions were placed in the living room and bedroom of my suite - allowing me to watch a variety of channels, inclusive of live Olympics coverage. I was also provided a landline telephone and could make unlimited calls to local numbers.   I can't thank the Park Avenue Rochester employees enough for making my stay so pleasurable and stress-free. Given the standard of accommodation, I sincerely intend to visit again as a paying customer in the near future. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Singapore.,…,I am serving 14 days stay home notice in Park Avemue Rochestor. I like the green concept of this hotel, safe environment by cutting down usage of one time disposable plastic cutleries and water bottles. The staff is very helpful and friendly too. Thank you!,It was a very good experience during my 14days quarantine in this hotel.overall the front desk and service staff was very good and friendly and very helpful. Not to forget mr.Praba from maintenance department had done a very good job when my room aircond isnt working and repaired it immediately.Thank you very much  for the good and best service.,Very lucky to sent to Park Avenue Rochester hotel to serve my 14 days quarantine after I back from Malaysia.It’s such a comfortable experience, I don’t really feel like having quarantine staying here as the vibe is nice and the staffs are attentive. The room is clean with the comfort bed and equipped with good necessities. Undeniably, an ideal accommodation to recommend to my friends and family.Great customer service rendered by my invisible butler Azhar and the team. Besides his wonderful positive attitude, Azhar made sure everything especially on my meals were perfect and took the time to talk. Thank you for all the tips and the motivation note too #runsgd #malaysianstrandedinsg #onenation,My husband and I arrived Singapore two weeks ago and been assigned to stay at Park Avenue Rochester for the 14-day quarantine, we are very blessed to be attended by Ms Lynn the Senior Duty Manager whom had given us a spacious service apartment concept for my husband is claustrophobic.  Throughout the stay, Lynn called us daily to check if everything is good, very professional and attentive, in fact, the entire team from receptions to housekeeping have been in good service, we are impressed ! Lynn even sent us a basket of snacks with a thank you card, whereas we should be the ones thanking her and her team, to make the quarantine stay smooth, well done and thank you !","Modern,Business",,,89,3,87
Capri by Fraser Changi City,4.5,"2,093 reviews",#80 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Used a travel voucher with staycation here. I didn’t have much expectation as this is more of a business hotel in Changi. What surprised me is the staff are well trained! They are knowledgeable, eager to help and courteous. I can say that they are better trained compared to other 5 stars luxury hotels in Sg and overseas! Zakiah helped me with my check-in which was efficient and she highlighted a few info I should note especially when there is no complimentary parking here. Athira made my checkout a breeze. I love the app to book facilities and made other requests. There is daily housekeeping (compared to others like pan Pac) without you having to ask for it. ,Indicated that we're spending our anniversary there and had a free upgrade to a deluxe room for 2 nights. Room is clean and very spacious, we could 💃 dance around and cook a nice meal in the room!  Love the use of Lola, their chatbot for booking of swimming pool facilities (use their Jacuzzi!) and housekeeping etc. We requested for a topup of shampoo and housekeeping came in 10 mins!  There's even a free 4h bicycle rental and we cycled to Jurassic mile and bk.   A big shoutout to all the staff at Fraser Changi, especially Mr Phillip at the concierge! They're very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had.   Best service in Singapore I had received so far! Thank you for making our stay a memorable one,  will definitely be back for more!,👍👍Thoughtful arrangements for the stay. Great and clean hotel with excellent service, and feel safe with the assurance of excellent Covid SMM. The deals comes with breakfast, even though now we can start dine in with 2 per table, we can still choose to have it takeaway back to the room. Wonderful experience, definitely going to return for future staycation.,Aged facility. The shower thermostatic system is not working to its full intent (tap vs shower head vs rain shower options are no longer aligned in room 607). Lack of free parking information should be volunteered during the booking service rather than it being a surprise (and please don't tell me it's slotted somewhere in the fine prints as that's considered ambushing and sinister). Pool limited to 2 pax for the whole of hotel and gym closure is conservative at its max with no alignment to the Gov's measure... it's just ""kiasi"". ,We have recently stayed at Capri by Fraser, Changi City for 2 nights in late March and it turned out to be one of the greatest experience we have in a local hotel.  From the moment we checked in, to the services provided by Housekeeping, help rendered by the in-house Technician, the experience was really top notch and all I can said is that it was an awesome experience throughout.  Shout out to especially Zakiah (front desk) & Justin (Housekeeping).  You guys are really great!!!   Keep up the good work!!!","Modern,Green",8333,Booking.com,100,2,75
"Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, Singapore",4.5,"1,088 reviews",#79 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Used our rediscover vouchers for a 2N stay here and loved it. Cosy room, did our own cooking and laundry in the kitchen, and enjoyed the view. Would recommend for a getaway if you just wanna stay in the room and not go out. Seamless check in and out too.,Outstanding service, cleanliness was tip top. Safety checks was look into every time to ensure an enjoyable stay. Pan Pacific Service Suites Beach Rd is well situated with endless cuisines. Near to Bugis and Arab Street. It was an enjoyable experience and worth it. 🥰,Checked in to this hotel over the festive weekend. Was expecting a crowd as many Singaporeans are still stuck in Singapore due to the pandemic, surprisingly check in was swift and I was given my rooms after a short wait. Service rendered at check in was very helpful and all my queries was answered.   Room was on 11 floor facing the city, view was nice and amenities in the room was well stocked, all kitchenwares, nespresso machine, oven, etc was provided.   Bed was comfy but the sofa is in need of a change..  Bathroom is well sized and only grouse is the water from shower area keeps flowing out of the glass door as the rubber that’s supposed to trap the water are faulty.  On the whole a satisfactory staycation for the family,To mention this staccato wasn't just any other staycation. It was a staycay after our wedding. First the front desk, the lady was a nightmare to speak to. We had earlier already indicated that it was the day of our wedding when we are checking in and requested for a room with tub but to our surprise the executive room doesn't come with one, instead we had to down grade to deluxe in order to get a tub. Puzzled but we agreed and also gave up the view because of the down grade. Faster forward to check in day, made a call early in the morning to check on the room but was told only then that the rooms for early check in can only be made known at 1.30pm which had left us scrambling because we wanted to do the bridal made up in the room. Nevertheless, we adjusted the plan and made, another call to check on our early check in. No only did the front desk not understand the meaning of early check in and told me to call back after 3pm for my ""early check in"" I later also found out that my room was only eventually ready at almost 4pm. Which by then I'm am already at my weddinf venue busy with preparations. I couldn't imagine if I did as the front desk said and turn up at the hotel at 1.30pm to ""check in"". All that horror aside, we finally arrived at the hotel just before midnight and was told by the reception that they almost wanted to cancel our room because we haven't checked in since the after despite me making countless amount of calls regarding the late check in. We still brushed in aside as it was the day of our wedding and we didn't want any unhappy things to have affected our mood. We proceeded to check and went up to a plain, mono room with no notes, nothing. Trust me when I say even a 3 and 4 star hotel did better. The following day my friend who I just found out was in the same hotel shared similar issues at check in and also further complained about their services. To summarize I just think it was the worst choice we had made to choose ""pan pacific"". We assumed that having picked such a trust worthy name in the industry would give us an experience of a lifetime. We indeed had an experience, for all the wrong reasons. I would say this is and will be my first and only time here. I took the time to write this to ensure that no one else's wife has to be that upset on their wedding day and friends who doesn't deserve this service.,…,For a Singaporean family looking to explore the area along Beach Road, Kampong Glam, Suntec, Gardens by the Bay, etc, the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites was a winning location.  Admittedly, the two hour delay for checking in, due to a circumstantial shortage in manpower, was not a good start, even if they did offer complimentary breakfast for the duration of our stay   But actually, once we got in, it was really comfy accommodations. The view of Kallang River and Marina Bay as we entered the door was not what one usually sees (we were on level 20). And then the suite itself was very tastefully furnished.  We got the serviced suite so our family of four (one teen and and one tween) could all stay in one unit without paying four limbs. So being all together, with common spaces, (living and dining) as well as separate bedrooms afforded privacy yet also allowed us to coordinate excursions easily.  The photos I have attached show the suite in general. It is as pampering as any hotel room but with some very key differences: • LOTS of wardrobe and storage space. We could almost have moved in here! • Dining Room and Kitchenette. We love our suppers but I have always hated throwing food waste away in the same room in which I am going to sleep, which happens in a hotel room. • Kitchen with lots of refrigerator and freezer space. • Washing machine-cum-dryer, with laundry powder. One load the night before we checked out meant almost no dirty clothes to contend with when we unpacked at home!  The suites are well located near all the areas I mentioned at the beginning and there is no shortage of things to do in the area.  The gym was well equipped and the pesudo-infinity pool on the rooftop was a great place to chill, do some laps and take in the scenery.  By the way, the breakfasts are HUGE so cut back if you are not hungry!  My kids say this is definitely a place in which to stay again!,…","Modern,City View",18170,ZenHotels.com,545,83,100

Kettle, coffee machine and window are dusty!  Room are quite cosy though. Only have 1 access card and got 1 extra one upon request. Packet water is given upon request.,The hotel staff (manager) Daryl processed our check-in. He bumped us up to a King-sized Bed. As it was our anniversary celebration, they gave black & gold balloons and floral decorations on the bed 💯💯💯  Hotel room layout is nice, quality fittings, modern layout (think Scandi / open wardrobe).  Location is good! (Singaporeans will know),I like the ring of feathers above the bed .. warding off evil like the Red Indians do.

Twice we were greeted by Daryl, his warmth and attention to detail set the benchmark for hotel frontline service standards. Appreciate his hospitality.

The St. Regis Singapore,4.5,"3,012 reviews",#77 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, French, Chinese, Filipino","Share, ,Check-in was fast. The room and bathroom were spacious; bigger than most hotel rooms in Singapore.   Although it was crowded during breakfast, the staff were attentive and efficient. The hotel serves a variety of food for breakfast. We enjoyed the breakfast.,Room was ready early in the day and check in procedure was efficient.   Love the design of the room though some furniture seemed dated.   Turn down service was completed when we were back to the room in the evening and the only butler service we asked for was coffee in the morning. Else there was nothing special about the butler service.,First staycation in Singapore after 2 years. I have redeemed 2 nights of Double Deluxe room with this property.  I had called to request for early check-in, and to my surprise, room was ready very early in the morning when I wake up.  Upon arrival (shortly after noon), didn't see anyone to assist with the luggage at the drive way.  Check in process is fast & quick, Magdalene is very friendly and always putting on a smile. She is very detailed to go through all the facilities booking process, guest registration process. (Thumbs up here!) She also offered the butler to take my luggage, which I kindly decline.  Upon entry to room 1207, everything seems perfect. Until you tried to use the facilities.  The bed is very aged, worst than what I have at home.  You can feel the spring in, the bedding when you lie down (I'm not more than 70kg!), and the side of the bed seems to be slanted, causing you to roll off easily.   Next toilet, there seems to be a layer of dust on the toilet walls, and in the bath tube (It is the kind of dust that has been accumulated for months in your kitchen wall, which you need to scrub in order to remove).   Seems like the room been vacant for quite awhile!  Butler service is non-existent in Singapore. You need to phone them for service. Coffee and tea is only served between 6-11am, which is not the standards across other St Regis properties I have stayed in (KL, BKK).  Turndown service is offered, they come knocking on your door everyday evening, which I declined too.  Facilities - there seems to be some refurbishment around Swimming pool? There's a heavy paint smell when I pop by to take a look. Pool is small given by the standard of the hotel :(  Given the COVID circumstances, booking of facilities is done via a QR code provided during chat in, or can do so via the Marriott Bonvoy app Live Chat, the Butler team will assist (but it takes awhile for them to come back with booking slots).   Didnt managed to try the breakfast or other facilities.   Dont think I will return here, my experience in KL and BKK St Regis are way better than here in Singapore.,…,Amazing service, from getting out of my Grab & all the way to the checking in process. Staffs were all smiling and greeting us. Even though it was NYE and was supposedly very busy, the staffs still managed to provide excellent customer service to their guests.   Absolutely love the Deluxe king room!!! Honestly, the only downside is that there isn’t any bidet. The room itself has speakers and on Agoda it states that the room is soundproof. We played loud music on NYE to see if it really is soundproof and  we didn’t receive any complaints. However, the next day when we played  “heads up” and were laughing (noise we made we definitely softer than the previous day)..we received a noise complaint and we weren’t playing any music. We were way quieter than the previous night though,, hence, our confusion. So up till now, i don’t know if the room is really soundproof or not…..and if it’s not, the room should be soundproof in order to utilise the surround sound speakers in the room.   Other than that, everything else is absolutely amazing!!! would love to come back here for my next staycation!,…,I had been looking forward to this staycation after not traveling for 2 years, but still with Titanium status intact. While we enjoyed the nice room, view, great shower and novelty of a hotel breakfast, the service significantly undermet our expectations for a top tier hotel.  At the entrance and check in the staff appeared to be overwhelmed even though the number of guests seemed to be moderate only.   The poor service and impression started at the check in. We were checking in for a 15th wedding anniversary stay. There was no acknowledgement of this. I mentioned this in passing and the host slightly giggled and ignored it. There was no second chair for my wife to sit in so she had to stand while I signed the paperwork. We paid for a suite and had gained a ‘suite nights’, upgrade to the Carline Astor suite, this was not acknowledged - I’m not sure if we actually got this or not, the suite was nice enough - high floor, botanical gardens view, but still… anyway a very poor and rushed experience. For a premium property, there is usually an offer to escort the guests to (at least) the lift, or even the room, or better still check in in the room, but nothing.   Also, ‘the Astor Bar is closed on Monday and Tuesday but we can bring you a drink in the room’. Firstly this was a let down and the snack brought with the drinks was really minimalistic also.   The so called butler service doesn’t really exist - it’s more like a tea coffee service + 2 items of ironing per day.  There is no lobby ambience, it seems like they don’t like people to loiter there.  The a la carte breakfast was ok, room was full and the staff were stretched, although pleasant. There seemed to be a mix of experienced and new staff learning the ropes. The coffee was undrinkable - this is a quick win - unburnt filter coffee would be much better.  There was no turndown service.  We were pushed into express checkout a couple of times but there was no draft bill provided the night before. At checkout the bonvoy desk was unattended which caused the guests behind us to be agitated.  On the plus side - the room was clean and in good shape. The nespresso pods were out of stock the first day but replenished the second.   My overall impression is that it is a good city hotel but seems to be a bit too busy for the available staffing, which is understandable at the moment. I would recommend it for a simple get away and the great hotel showers and bed, but not for the full 5 star experience. I hope they will be able to improve the softer aspects of the experience.,…","Luxury,Classic",22578,StRegis.com,151,31,100
Ramada by Wyndham Singapore at Zhongshan Park,4.0,"3,809 reviews",#73 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,This hotel is conveniently located beside Zhongshan Mall — a small mall but adequately equipped with several eateries including an NTUC FairPrice outlet and 7-11 so food is not an issue. The hotel also has an in-house Chinese restaurant (New Ubin Seafood) but it’s on the pricey side.   The hotel is relatively new and the room is quite modern with a large comfy king-sized bed and bay window seat. But when they add in an extra roll-away bed, there isn’t much space to move around. Due to the pandemic, you have to pre-book swimming slot but it’s not crowded so we have a relaxing time at the lap pool.  There is a small park - Zhongshan Park - just below the hotel with a pond and nothing much. But we visited the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (Wan Qing Yuan) just across the road, from the hotel, which is free admission for locals. It was quite an eye-opener into the history of China’s revolution led by Dr Sun Yat Sen from his base in Singapore.  We have not been on an overseas vacation for almost 2 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this staycation is a welcome change of fresh breeze, thanks also to front desk staff Liana for her great service!  ,…,Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband and daughter on our trip to Singapore.

Rooms: Beautiful city view from 14th floor,comfy beds, beautiful decor, tea coffer maker, executive desk, safe locker, bathh robe n slippers Washroom: Nice rain shower, clean toilets, toiletries, clean towels Pool n Gym: Enjoyed swimming in the hotel pool and my kiddo also enjoyed in the Kids pool Breakfast: Buffet breakfast was food. Lot of options and live counters too. Mall: Shopping Mall just besides the hotel with an interconnection from the ground floor. Lot of great options to have meals. Moreover a supermarket where you can buy beer, snacks etc and bring into your room. Nearbuy area: Lot of nice restaurants amd take away, nearbuy. Some Indian restaurants as well nearby. Shuttle and Metro: Hotel provides free shuttle to nearby Metro station - Novena  We mostly used Uber and Grab taxi, quite convenient and affordable.  Overall an awesome stay. They even arranged for birthday cake slice and personalised card for my hubby's bday. 5 stars to Ramada. Would stay again and recommend to others as well.  ,…,So I had a bad experience the night before at another hotel...so I switched to here the next day.  I didn't even stay the whole night this time...I switched again...here is why:  Check-In was a nightmare!  They couldn't locate my confirmation at first.  I had to try to sign into their disfunctional wifi to try to access the email on my smart phone.  This took forever...then even after I gave them the confirmation information, they took another 30 minutes trying to confirm my identity.  Then they gave me a hard time for having one companion even though the reservation said I had no companions.  Then they wouldn't add in my Wyndham Rewards Network Membership because they said I didn't qualify.  I asked for an explanation ""WHY I didn't qualify.""  Then she just grabbed another, manager whose English was bad, giving a really long excuse that had no relevance.  IN the end, they said my ""rates don't qualify.""  I've never had problems like this before.  They said in order to get Wyndham benefits, I MUST have only booked through Ramada's website...I think this might be their personal policy or some Singapore thing...because the other two hotels would not give the membership benefits either even though the rest of the world give it.    So anyways, after a frustrating first impression, I completed check-in and then went up to the room.  The central AC was not working and the ""superior room"" which I paid decent money for was pretty darn small.  I tried to do some work, but it was noisy.  I laid in bed for a bit...then I had to get up because i had rashes all over my body.  I had what seemed like mosquito bites  all over.  But there was NO mosquitoes ANYWHERE in the room.  I looked carefully...there were these very small, mini red ants crawling all over the bed and the business table.  OMG, those things have some nasty bites.  They were still on me...I took an immediate shower, but I had to stay in robes, because the ants had already gotten into my luggage.  I called for service and assistance, but it took them almost one hour to come to my room.  Then once they got to my room, they asked for proof of the pest problem.  I showed them my arms, legs, and neck...but they insisted on showing me the ants...I was kind of irritated, because all they had to do was open their eyes...I mean these things were crawling everywhere in the room.  After taking a while to ""make documentations"" of the incident...they changed me to another room.  It was a DOWNGRADE...an even smaller room!  They offered to clean my luggage and clothes of the bugs...but apparently they charged me after wards.  They didn't leave me with the new room keys, and they said they would have someone bring it to me.  I waited and waited...and in the end I asked for new keys three times, before giving up and just going down to reception to just pick it up on my own.  When I tried to pick up the keys, the person gave me a hard time on why I need new/more keys...I explained the situation, but she kept giving me attitude that my account was not notated and she was not informed...WTH...  Then I just went up and packed and came down to check out to leave...this was 3-4 AM ish.  Then two managers came out...they were SOOO nice...I've never met more smiling and nice people in a Singaporean Hotel...EVER.  WOW...they asked what they can do to make me stay or make my experience better...I was speechless.  I offered a late check out..you got to be kidding me!  Late Check Out?!  Not drinks or room upgrades...or even future discounts...but a late check out.  After feeling more insulted, I politely declined and tried to leave.  Then they had the nerves to ask me for a good feedback and survey...  What were they thinking...  DO NOT go here!!!,…,We stayed here for 6 nights after a long trip to New Zealand. We were looking for something comfortable with a good swimming pool at less than a £100 a night. Not that easy in Singapore. The Ramada came up complete trumps. Contrary to earlier reports the reception staff were very helpful and they gave us a late checkout of 2pm. The room though a standard hotel room was a decent size with a comfy bed and a first rAte shower room. There was free unlimited internet which was fast for a hotel. The swimming pool was excellent for a business hotel. Large with a decent set of sun beds and pleasant landscaping, it was a nice temperature as it was not overshadowed by tAll buildings. The depth was never over 1.4m. There was a good sized hotel gym too. The breakfast was a good mix of, Chinese, Indian and European. My only criticism was that it virtually never changed over 6 days. One of the useful hotel features is that it is part of a small mall with a cafe, restaurants, hairdressers, and a large full service supermarket open until 11pm. Finally the hotel has clearly improved the shuttles. They were very regular well into the evening. And there was no problem getting a seat. The destination Novena is a big mall with lots of eateries. The street outside has a small food centre nearby as well as a number of restaurants. To anyone worrying the hotel is far out of  the centre, don't. It is an easy and short trip to Orchard Road, Chinatown, Little India or the new bay developments. As I said earlier we paid less than a £100 including breakfast through an agency.  ,…,We arrived very early in the morning and they gave us the room even we could not check in until 2pm.  Staff was very helpfull. Nice place, very good breakfast.   We also ask for a high room and they did it. Is our second time here and we will come again.","Park View,Mid-range",10326,getaroom.com,54,7,81
Holiday Inn Express Singapore Orchard Road,4.0,"1,235 reviews",#70 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,This report is based on a couple of one night stays in October and November 2013. The room type was exactly the same on both occasions on the 14th and 15th floors, facing the construction site of the Hereen shopping mall. This was not my first choice (that being HI Orchard City Centre, just a little further down) Read on to find out what I really thought of and whether I would stay again.  This was my first stay at a HI Express and I was surprised by a number of things: firstly, the room (while pared backed compared to HI and IC) was still comparable to their standard rooms and was well equipped. Secondly, the price. Quality Singapore accommodation is not cheap, and this HI Express (while still relatively expensive) was better value than the HI. The rooms are modern, clean, and, fresh. The bathroom is a glassed off area to one corner; average size and clean with good quality bath linen. There is a small writing desk and office type chair to do work if you need to, as well as a really comfy recliner for relaxing. Complimentary bottled water and tea and coffee making facilities are provided. You can stow away your clothes in the large wardrobe, which also has a mini bar, room safe and ironing board. But most important of all - the bed. IHG generally do not (except for one occasion in New York) cut corners with beds. This one was as comfortable as anything offered by InterContinental hotels I've stayed in. One is given a choice of four soft and firm pillows and the bed linen is truly fine. For those needing to stay in touch, wifi is available (speed is good but not great). Because of my IHG Plat status I don't need to pay for this, but I believe non members might have to(?)  The only bits and pieces regular hotel guests will notice missing are: bathrobes, slippers, iron, individual toiletries and a turn-down service. But thats it! Of course, there is no pool, gym, spa, restaurant, gift shops etc etc. But from my experience, I very rarely made use of these extraneous services, so did not miss them. Did I mention the close proximity to Orchard Road? One avoids the noise emanating from the shopping strip because this hotel is set just a little further back from it. Its really only a few steps and yet made all the difference for peace and quiet.  I really enjoyed my stay. But only one thing marred my visit: the building site next door. The noise is incessant all day long till around 6:30PM. This is in no way the hotel's fault, but jet-lagged guests needing sleep during daylight hours might be inconvenienced. My advice is to ask for a room on the other side or bring ear plugs! Were it not for this outside factor, I would certainly have awarded 4* instead of the current 3* I certainly intend to make this my base for transiting in Singapore and am sure my ratings will improve by next year!  In summary, I. would recommend this hotel to those requiring good quality accommodation near Orchard Road, at relatively cheaper rates. Incidentally, this hotel's main clientele are holiday makers.  PROS: Good quality rooms, Close to Orchard Road. Relatively cheaper. CONS: Noise from adjoining building site.  If me report helped in your decision-making, then please take the time to click the ""was this report helpful?"" button located below. This is the only feedback I receive from you and I fully appreciate your acknowledgement, dear reader.,…,At the moment I am still staying at this hotel and the service of this hotel is the worst I ever encoutered as an loyal IHG member.  I am a frequent traveler and visited many hotels troughout Asia and Europe. What I encoutered here is just not acceptable at all. I ADVISE NOBODY TO BOOK THIS HOTEL FOR THE COMING MONTHS IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO SLEEP AND HAVE A PEACEFUL STAY. There is heavily construction everywhere around the hotel and it won't be finished for a while. When I booked this hotel there was no single line of information on this. If I knew this in advance I would never booked the hotel at all! I feel misled and scammed for this amount of money, really not acceptable at all!!! Every morning I get ruffly waken by iron smashing on iron at 7 AM and my room has a view, towards a big crane! I payed over $2000,- to stay in this hotel and cannot even have peace at all, the noise is SO bad. And then I'm even sleeping with earplugs :S When I got to the front desk to ask for a room change they put me in a room where the noise was EVEN MORE bad (do you even know your own hotel I was thinking?) I am an IHG member and when I requested for a solution they did not offer any upgrade, but want to transfer me to another hotel. And then they even dare to ask me another $300-$500 to pay extra :S Really?? I got offered no upgrade beside this at all! Is this how you treat your loyal customers and IHG member? I am really shocked by this and never would have expected this from a Singapore hotel which had this reviews. Yesterday when I came in the lady even ignored me, while she offered me a voucher the day before I still did not receive by today.  I do not feel taken serious at all and hereby again request everyone who want to have a nice stay in Singapore city centre to NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. It's the worst I had and it really ruined my holiday up till now because I cannot get a decent rest at all. I have to stay for another 6 nights but rather feel like going somewhere else because I am frustrated by the noise everyday. Hope I can save somebodies holiday/trip with this warning.,…,We stayed at this hotel en route to Brisbane, Australia, A nice modern hotel very well located just off Orchard Road with plenty of Shopping, Bars and Restaurants within walking distance. We arrived early morning to find that we were able to check in to our room which was great after two long flights from Manchester via Dubai. The staff were very friendly and accommodating throughout our trip. The rooms are modern and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was included and was buffet style catering for a wide range on nationalities, the food was good. I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this hotel, it was great.,Have stayed this Holiday Inn Express before last year and so this holiday made it our base and stayed three separate visits over two weeks while we visited Cambodia and Tioman (Malaysia). We left baggage here in between times so didn’t take everything to every destination. Hotel location is just behind Orchard Road (main shopping area). Still very well run and clean and we would be happy to return.  Staff are all very helpful/polite and two members actually remembered us. Breakfast was very nice although they warn you it’s busy at times so best try and avoid peak periods. All the staff say hello good morning which I thought lovely.  Ms Wang especially was very friendly and helpful in the breakfast room and used to find us a table if busy.  I expect we will be back next year as, well.,…,I have stayed in Holiday Inns worldwide and am a Priority Club member. I always find the standards consistent and I know what I'm getting. The Express chain is the budget model in the chain and you cannot expect the same facilities as a full service Hotel. As I very rarely use the gym, pool and a few other things I didn't miss them. Having said that I thought the rooms a good size, extremely clean, modern and had Safe etc and we all slept well. The breakfast was small but more than sufficient. The staff were very friendly, helpful and polite without exception. This is a new Hotel and obviously run by enthusiastic management and staff, keep up the good work you are all doing great.  We only stayed two night but next time I visit Singapore I would be more than happy to stay here, again.,…","Centrally Located,Modern",,,539,91,100
PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road,4.0,"5,250 reviews",#65 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,After my covid test at the  Changi Airport, I asked which hotel I would be put in (mandatory hotel quarantine)  as my friends n relatives stayed at pretty well known 5 stars hotels.     I was disappointed but my disappointment turned to a blessing in disguise as the room was renovated, spacious with laminated flooring rather than carpet.   My preference for laminated flooring is because it is more hygienic.   Overall, looks fine and not crappy.  Contacting the front office was a breeze via WhatsApp.   When I requested for local food as I was tired of sausages, omelette for breakfast, the kitchen acceded to my request too.   I had nice chapati, prata, dim sum, good nasi lemak….  Upon check out, the concierge and  ‘bell man’ were  very helpful and friendly.     l The hotel is near, to amenities so personally I think one can consider if the price is right.,…,I spent 10 days here! It was a really nice room, spacious, clean with really comfortable bed! The staff was super friendly, very helpful. They ensured that I did my self test, constantly ask if I needed anything else. Big plus for me was that the room was NOT carpeted and they installed water filter for drinking water! Fantastic eco friendly hotel.,Staff was very helpful and welcoming, with full services during my quarantine stay including room and laundry services. They also provided us a whatsapp number to contact whenever we need anything. Made quarantining much easier to past. The rooms are also very new and clean.,The room is minimalistic in design which is a good thing. Wardrobe is made easily accessible where it should be without enclosure. I do see that the management has put some thought on being envoironmentally friendly. The idea of drinking filtered water and remove the use of plastic bottle should be the standard practice for all in hospitality industry. And they do pay attention to remove as much as disposible bottle (shampoo and soap bottles and etc.) as they can.  If I were to nitpick, perhaps they could provide a bigger table space at least enough for a laptop and some space to dine or write. Not to forget, better choice for the selection of TV channel.   Otherwise it is a pretty comfortable stay, with enough floor space, pretty comfy bed and pillow. ,My mum and my sis was being allocated at this hotel for their 14 SHN. As we know this hotel was a 4* hotel but we asked for some mineral water on the first day of arrival they told my mum there a water kettle and water tab that u can help yourself. This make me angry as they already tired over the long journey only few bottles of mineral also they refused to give.  2nd thing the food that the hotel served cannot be accorded to our preference. They served Chinese food and western food on alternative day. Where my mum do not like western as old people they usually prefers Chinese food.  Overall hotel stay is good. But cos of this 2 things I will give only 1 star.  On behalf on my mum","Family,City View",,,309,24,99
Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel,4.0,"4,802 reviews",#66 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,What a wonderful experience trashing my initial thoughts of how to cope with being ""imprisoned"" all be it even at a 5 star hotel? The moment I arrived at 2+am on the 18th June was a breeze with courtesy received. Entering the room #2306 was a relief with spacious, very clean and well equipt with neccesities. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The view gave me the serenity needed for this situation as it faces the Singapore river and city view even Batam can be seen on a clear day. Very good wifi connection helps keep my sanity intact.  Most of all what was more stunning was the great guest oriented hotel personnel which truly was amazing and what guests always expected nomatter what the situation or reason to stay can be. I must humbly commend them for making mine a, pleasantly memorable one...   To Jiun Lee and Cheryl from 'One Touch' for keeping me company with their friendly and sincerity I can feel just over our daily telephone conversations and I was very pleasantly surprised that them knowing I'm a BTS ARMY presented me with an encouragement greeting card with BTS poster print! Now that was AWESOME! Liya (hope I spelt it correctly) from the same department was enthusiastic when we spoke on my checking out day. To all of you, gamsahamidah...  To GCW Hotel Manager Mr Terence Ng, my sincere appreciation for taking good care of me in making my stay trouble and stress free. You have a great team! To Kelvin whom I met briefly at the lobby upon my departure I appreciate your courtesy. To everyone from housekeeping, in room dining, to Certis Cisco, the M.O.H., I thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart. Grand Corpthorne Waterfront... you are indeed fantabulously Grand! 👍👍👍,…,The Grand Copthorne resides in Robertson Quay, about 1 mile up river from Raffles Plaza and Boat Quay. At the time of writing the Quay was undergoing renovation and the area to the front of the hotel was something of a builders yard. If you can, turn a blind eye to the noise and dust and take a look. From the outside the hotel looks as grand as a Jumeira Beach or Nusa Dua 5 star resort. This is slightly deceptive however as you will see. Read on...  The reception area is rather small considering the size of the hotel - over 500 rooms and 30 stories - and this area can regularly become crowded. 4 lifts whizz you up to your floor. The shape of the hotel means some rooms are larger than others. Deluxe rooms have wooden flooring, mini bar, room service, remote TV, bathroom with tub, and stand-in shower, toiletries, tea/coffee facilities and of course air con. For a much better room head for the executive floors (27-30). I originally had a small sized room on floor 30 but had a look around and moved to one of the corner rooms on the 29th floor, which was facing the river and at least 1.5x larger than other rooms in the same category. Executive facilities include high speed internet access, 2 free items of laundry per day, newspaper, breakfast on the executive floor, evening cocktails and free minibar soft drinks.  Breakfast from the executive floor is basically continental, but its pleasant, and affords a fabulous view of the City skyline. Cooked eggs and waffles are available here too. In Cafe Brios in the lobby the breakfast served is very good, with international flavours aplenty and the ability to eat inside or out.  The hotel features a gym with onsite instructors, 2 outdoor tennis courts and a rather dissapointingly small pool, again considering the hotel's size. That said, it was never busy during my 3 days here.  Getting around is a breeze, taxis are cheap and always at hand, whilst there is a boat jetty directly outside the hotel which has stops all the way down to Clifford Pier. 5 mins walk down Kim Seng Road (right from the hotel entrance) is an indoor mall (Great World City) with some excellent restaurants, supermarkets and shops.  I was most impressed with the staff attitude, service, and attention to detail whilst here, and although my eyes told me the hotel is more akin to a 4 star establishment, the service and staff made it feel 5 star.  Definitely worth a look. ,…,Have just returned from staying at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront and it was fantastic. Our 5 day stay in Singapore was a present for my mum's 50th Birthday and we couldnt have picked a nicer hotel. The day before we left I emailed the hotel informing them of the reaon for this trip and when we arrived there was a birthday cake, birthday card, chocolates and 6 red roses in the room courtesy of the hotel!  Good things about hotel:- 1) Located outside the main hustle and bustle of orchard road and the CBD, perfect for a relaxing holiday. But rest of singapore easily accesible by very very cheap taxis- S$3-4 to Orchard road, little india, china town etc 2) Very cheap river taxi to transport you up and down the singapore river, just ask at reception and they call it for you. 3), Beautiful swimming pool and jacuzi on the 6th floor, which was very quiet while we were there. 4) Fantastic food that doesnt cost that more than eating out and about. 5) Friendly staff especially door men and bell boys. 6 Hotel room spotless,  towels changed everyday, hairdryer in bathroom.  Fantastic!!!! Will definately be going back to this hotel again!!! ,…,Stayed there for a total of 8 nights in Dec'04/Jan'05. The exterior appears very grand, however the superior rooms are rather small (27sqm). At the second time we were upgraded to Deluxe room which has a reasonable size. The hotel is only about 6 years old, so everything is very well maintained and in excellent condition and cleanlyness. It is not directly in the shopping centre, but Orchard Road is only 4 bus stops or a 5-10min taxi ride (about SGD 4) away. For Christmas day we had booked the dinner buffet, but they couldn't find our reservation. We still got a table and enjoyed the dinner. Breakfast is rather average for this hotel category. Overall I would rate this hotel rather a good 4star than 5 star, but given that you can book it on the internet (we booked via, asiabesthotel) at around SGD 135 incl. taxes it is great value for money. ,…,We have just returned from a 9 night stay at this hotel.  We were very impressed and would definitely recommend it to others.  We (family of 4, children aged 9 & 7) stayed in a room on one of the executive floors booked through Expedia.  We had great views out over the city and this was particularly spectacular at night.  The room came with extra executive floor privileges including complimentary breakfast, 2 items of laundry per day, free soft drinks from mini bar and cocktails and hors d'oeurves each evening.  The pool is fairly small but was never crowded during our stay - often we were the only ones using it!    We ate at Brio's on two occasions - both buffets - once in the evening and again for Sunday brunch.  There was a good selection of food - both local and, international dishes, and there was childrens entertainment and a kids food area for the Sunday brunch.  We also ate in the Piano bar which does snack type food (sandwiches, satay etc) - the portions were substantial and the food very good.  The hotel is not located centrally but is not far from all the key places to go.  There is a free shuttle bus to Orchard Road but we used taxis as they are very reasonably priced.  There is a tourist bus stop (hop on hop off loops of city) located at the hotel across the road (approx. 5 min walk) which is used by the main companies that offer this service in Singapore.  The restaurants of Clarke Quay are a 15-20 minute walk away along the river - there is a well lit wide path on both sides of the river to walk along.  We found this walk fine in the evening in the (slightly) cooler temparatures but it would probably be too far to go by foot in the heat of the day.  All the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for you.  All in all a really pleasant stay in a smart, well maintained hotel with great service. ,…","River View,Great View",8418,Etrip,111,15,94
"Duxton Reserve, Autograph Collection",4.5,188 reviews,#71 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid private parking nearby,"English, Chinese","Share, ,We stayed at the Duxton Reserve on a weekend Staycation - it's just such a lovely place. The duplex suites are generously large and luxurious, and the staff are just so friendly and kind. Though just as a heads up, there isn't a bathtub. But the showers are pretty good!   Definitely the kind of staycation to dress up and take pictures at too, remember to grab a drink at the extremely symmetrical art deco bar! It's near a ton of great food around Tanjong Pagar and super accessible, you could definitely take the train here.Also remember to get the breakfast if you can, it's served at Yellow Pot which is 10/10! Thanks for the amazing stay guys!,As a Marriott platinum member, they were nice enough to upgrade me to their Pearl suite (with its pearly white room theme). The room is nicely spaced out with a chill area to relax. Staying in this hotel, one will be spoilt for choice in terms of F&B in the surrounding areas. Staff is very courteous and nice in general.,This is exactly what it feels like. The rooms, the decor and the bar and restaurant. Choosing a stay at the Duxton Reserve is wanting to experience a 19 century wonder in one of Singapore's historical enclave with a deep heritage. All the shophouses are here are gazzetted for conservation and the Duxton Reserve is a property that still preserves that nostalgic feel. The area is near to Singapore's inconic Chinatown and the adjoining shophouses and eateries have a distinct character. I love the food and I love the bar. ,A very nice hotel. The moment you step in, you have a different feel with the nice fragrance and uique oriental decoration.  The check in is fast and the staff is friendly. We are lucky that they have provided 1 of the 2 signature opium rooms for us. The room has a very unique layout.  Its mini bar is also very beautiful.   Overall, definitely recommended for couples to stay. ,Great food, location, hospitality and all the conveniences will make you want to stay again.  I am thankful for all the hotel staff for making it a memorable and enjoyable trip ever. Can’t wait to go back.",,21931,Autograph,871,95,100
Hawaii Hostel,2.0,32 reviews,#280 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,,"Share, ,This hostel should be a tourist attraction. People should flock there and marvel at this inter-dimensional gate that shows glimpses of post-apocalyptic Earth. Decay and destruction all over the place. The mould and smell have seeped into the walls and mattresses. Seriously, it blows my mind how someone can ask money from people to stay there! And it wasn't a negligible amount either. This hostel is so bad that since the moment I saw it, I've been having nightmares about it! Even though I was pretty desperate for an accommodation and its location is good, there was no doubt in my mind I couldn't stay there.,Possibly the most depressing place I've ever stayed. No lobby just a door on street with stairs heading up to a grubby office.  The rooms are tiny, old and dirty. I was intent on staying somewhere downtown cheaply. Definitely not worth going through that experience though. Couldn't wait to get out in the morning. ,This hostel is located very near to the city center and only few bus stops to many of the attractions. Being one of the cheapest hostel in crazily expensive Singapore, the rooms are nothing special, but still acceptable to me and not as bad as others had described. If you are looking for something new and clean, stay away! But be prepare to pay more. Overall, it is still good value for a budget traveller.,Location:  It is 2nd floor of shop lot. Good Location. very near City Center, walking distance to Bugis Junction, famous ""Si Ma Lu"" Guan Yin temple.  Environment:  Old shop lot style with many small individual room, the corridor is small & dark, the stay look grim.  Room:  In the room I stay got 1 queen size bed, table, air-con and so call bathroom. Mattress and bedsheet were old, make me wonder if they are clean.  The so call bathroom is only a place which just enough for 1 person to squeeze in for shower. The only good point - Aircon is cool. Not like others hostel, u will feel & heard ppl walking around, but you can heard the vehicle pass by sound.  Advice: If you are not having super tight budget, not advisable to stay here,The whole place needs a major overhaul and is not fit for accomodation. They should use some of the funds obtained to date to clean and paint the premises. The toilets were very smelly. Shower was mouldy. Air con didn’t work.",,,,458,74,100
Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena,4.5,423 reviews,#63 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Stayed here before the pandemic. Location is only a couple of MRT stops from orchard & CBD but in a relatively unknown neighborhood. Hotel is connected to a mall which also connects to the MRT station, but entrance can be a bit confusing to find at first.  Stayed in one of their regular king bed room on the high floor. I think the room was well appointed and had decent size with a nice view.  However, the highlight of my stay would be the rooftop pool. Relaxing in the pool after a day's work felt really good, and you could get a great view of Singapore skyline, including the Marina Bay Sands from afar.   For the price point, would highly consider this hotel again when visiting Singapore. ,This was my second trip to Singapore. The first trip we stayed at the Fairmont which we enjoyed. This time we wanted to try a different neighborhood with more local feel. The Courtyard at Novenna hits the spot for us. It was not the usual experience as you would expect from Courtyard properties elsewhere. It was surprisingly much better. The room was new, modern, and clean. Check-in was a bit slow but staff was very polite and professional. Housekeeping staff maintained the room nicely. There are plenty of good food options within 3-5 minutes walk. On the next day, we looked lost trying to figure out where to go to take the MRT, a manager noticed and told us where to go then walked with us out of the hotel to the adjacent building where the MRT station was located. Inside this, station, 1 stop from city center, was a supermarket, bank, shops, and plenty of food options. Across the big street was a great chicken rice restaurant—no need to go to hawker center for long lines. Overall a good experience in this part of town. ,…,A very good hotel. New and fashionable . The food was nice. The service was good . Had good time with family there. Swimming pool and its environment was really good and environment was very relaxed.  Highly recommended for stay and chill.,Booked in for a 2 night stay over the weekend. Room is not big, but well designed and honestly better than some of the 5-stars I've stayed.  Breakfast spread is simple, but sufficient to fill you up. Did not have a chance to try the rooftop bar while there. There are quite  a number of F&B outlets in the malls beside, or you can visit the Balestier or Little India districts nearby.   The gym is small though, with only free weights, treadmills, elliptical and bike, so if hitting the gym is a big part of your routine, you might need to factor this in. Pool is small too, only about 20m long.   That said, I feel this is probably one of the better options in this price point, so I'll certainly consider if looking for a staycation option!,Ms Kiki Chan is professional, welcoming, knows her products very well and takes the time to get to know her customers. My Godma and I were having dinner at Sky 22 when we were so pleasantly delighted by Ms Kiki's attention for detail, warm personable service and wonderful conversation skills - that we would go back again just because of her. It helped that the food was great too! Ms Kiki Chen went out of her way to offer to help us after dinner and it's service like these rendered by her that makes it truly memorable and a great experience!","Great View,City View",,,196,8,82
"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",4.5,"5,326 reviews",#60 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Valet parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I usually travel solo and have chosen pickering as a choice for a 6-nights stay to refresh the mind and spirit as a getaway from home during the pandemic travel restrictions. The greenery in this hotel always provides a respite and I like that the air con is not too cold and the corridor area facing chinatown point is non-air conditioned allowing more fresh air to circulate. I admire the hotel's efforts to keep the flora healthy with regular gardening work done. I also like that there is no plastic water bottle at this hotel and I usually just drink from the tap or boil water. The minimalist design of each room soothes the mind and the food at Lime restaurant is delicious. The service is great too and I look forward to repeated stays in future.,Staff were friendly and accommodating to give us late checkout at 2pm cause we were with a young infant. Note that the card key will expire at 12pm on checkout day, so have to get the staff to assist to tap into the lift and to our door.  Room was spacious, but cot can only be placed on one side of the room, which happens to be the colder side, so infant had woke up multiple times at night cause it was too cold, eventually we set back to 26 deg C and adults slept without blanket.  Mini drink bar made it hard for breastfed mum to keep their pump parts. As for the potable water, it came in glass bottles with metal tab. Be careful as the tabs could be easily broken during opening.  Much appreciated the bathtub and bathing facilities were baby friendly and my infant likes this, bathtub a lot!,…,Good service in general. 😊Twinkle was very nice  Chefs were all nice too  Food at lounge is so so only needs improvement  Wasn’t upgraded which was sad as there was no bath tub. collection club rooms should all come with bath tubs as they are premium rooms Location is quite good next to Chinatown  Rained both days no chance to go pool area.  Kind of them to give a bday cake !  Check out was done for us quickly too !,Enjoyed a wonderful birthday weekend here with my wife. Really enjoyed the aesthetics and design of both the hotel and the room which came with a great view of the city. Having a hotel situated within the CBD really allowed for us to travel to many good dining spots easily. Hotel staff were also wonderful and helpful by allowing us to extend our checkout by an hour. However, We faced an issue with the cleaning crew. While I was changing in the room, the cleaning crew just opened the door and came into our room unexpectedly! Luckily it was me and not my wife changing. They apologised and mentioned that it was stated on their app that we had already checked out. Again this miscommunication may have resulted in them walking in on something more unsavoury(let’s leave it at that)., Also, cleaning crew may consider knocking on the door before entering in the future. I don’t think this would happen to most people as it was an unfortunate incident.  This incident left a bad taste in our mouth, on what otherwise would have been a great birthday staycation.,…,The hotel layout and room design create an exclusive feel of being in a private cabin in a resort. The Collection Club benefits are really good value for money, with delicious bites and drinks. The service at the club lounge is top-notch. Serene and her team really ensure that every guest is taken care of even when the place is packed. They always accommodate our dietary needs (vegetarian) and the plant-based items that are on the main menu are very good too. This is our 4th stay and we will definitely returna","Modern,Park View",22987,getaroom.com,841,119,100
Asphodel Inn Singapore,3.0,137 reviews,#284 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,because of our bad experience at the greendili, we moved out and stayed here instead. they are just near each other. we became friends with one of the staff who was very accommodating to us. but the guy who he switched shift with was the exact opposite of him. had to pay 35SGD for the extra person charge. we had complimentary bottles of water. air conditioner though wasn't that cold. bathroom was spacious. near Ferrer Park mrt station (around 2blocks). checked out around 10am and they let us leave our bags at their storage room, went back for it around 8pm.,It was decent hotel with good service from hotel staff.  My room had lot of red ants, however they changed my room later on. Only thing missing was fridge in rooms. Want to give 3.5 stars however don't have that option to select.,The hotel is not really how it looks like in pics, it's really small, u only have space to walk If u have a big lagguage bag it won't fit in the cupboard and can't keep outside as well. the windows don't open and hotel is filled with cigarette smoke, no one really bothers about it. They don't even send water if needed they will ask u to go and collect the water. BAD HOTEL!!!!!,It’s ok for the price if you are not gonna be in room for most of your day.   Room is tiny. Bathroom is very small. Very very basic. For a very short stay ok.if not don’t book it.reception area is not welcoming or receptionist never greet on your arrival. Pictures and details what they put is completely misleading Very basic tiny place. ,Room was basic and clean for a night stay. Bathroom tiles were moldy in some part, it would be good to have a deep cleaning and scrub on the bathroom tiles/walls to give it a clean look. Kettle and mineral waters were provided. There are groceries shop and restaurants near by to explore but limited choices.   The hotel is walking distance to Ferra Park MRT station.  It took me a while to find the hotel though due to confusing sign of the Race Course Road from the different exit. Do go for exit B instead, more straight forward.",,,,157,16,89
The Bohemian Chic Hostel,4.0,220 reviews,#56 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,The worst experience I have ever been , i couldn't image that my shoes was lost INSIDE. Yes, exactly! INSIDE THE BOHEMIAN ! And i lost it in 2 minutes. When i asked you for helping, the first words you said that: "" we hadn't recommended you left your shoes here"" OMG! So where else i could leave it, in the restroom? And you had just acted like it wasn't your business at all when i asked you for more helping. Please do not stay in this hotel if you don't want to be stolen anything,I and my friend booked the hostel 4 months in advance. Several days before we went there, they contacted us to reconfirm and asked what time we will arrive. It seems all was in place.  On the day we arrive, Desmond-the hostel guy said that there's some problems in the booking and we were transfered (forcely, because we have no other choices!), to his sister's hostel in Lavender street! Cmon, dude. We pick the hostel because of its location in chinatown which easily accessible, And now we had to go to Lavender which is quite faraway from our plan!!  It was really upsetting.  Turns out when we arrive in the transferred hostel, it is still half-construction! There were some left-over of the woods and hasnt been done on some places. And there were bunch of peoples who were having, the same condition like us!  It was really, really disaster.  You should reconsider if you want to book this hostel. Really.,…,Good location, very easy to find and there are a lot of chinese restaurant around. The room and toilet is clean, but the beds are full of BED BUGS!!! Now I'm suffering from bed bug's bite all over my body...,i am a returning guest, but this time my family had a bad memories of this hostel i was shock in the morning when we had to leave that my son complained that something bite his back and cheek also his neck, after i check outside the room.. OMG many bed bugs bite around his neck n cheek and at the back of his belly... i was rushed to the bed to check and i found out 4 bed bugs were there, 2 on the lower bed and 2 on the top bed (i paid 3 bed, mine is ok...) that was on the 2nd fl, on 2C next to the door, i hated them n i killed them, the blood was fresh when i pinched the bed bugs n should left a mark until the morning when the staff pick all the linen (i just want to show them that i was not lying/ that time no staff around when we  left at 4.30am on sunday 22nd of june) i, suggest the management to locked the room down for few hours to be spray to kill those bed bugs as i believe they are still there but no response from the management yet on my email. think to stay at the other backpacker as i am now have a bad memory on pillow n toast.,…,This place is fantastic!! The bed is so comfortable, I almost didn't want to get out of bed to explore Singapore. A locker is provided and you can rent a lock for a good price ( can't remember). It's very clean and the aircon is a life saver in Singapore's hot weather. The attic is amazing with a massage chair for free use. free netbook and wireless internet provided.

Atlantis Pods @ Bugis,3.5,27 reviews,#157 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,the place is very clean, excellent location, there is no other better place to stay if not this one, the living room and kitchen where a mini cafe is served is very cozy, good bathroom, good room, thanks for all . ,I loved it .  Super clean. AC in room was excellent.  For the price - excellent value. Nice breakfast space. Green space across the road for yoga early or even a run.  Fast response to my email. Hot water - great shower.  I am here for 24 visa😂 run - so it was perfect. I found it on airbnb and it said ”female only room $47”. That was true and I shared with 8 gals in little pods with pull down roller blind.  All gals were super quiet - I totally would not have ”shared With 8” but I never knew that at time of Booking. It was actually fine. I night. No problem. Next street is tons of cute outdoor eatery. Street closed to traffic on Fri sat sun - cool little vibe and cheap eats. Silky tofu For $8.  A 15-year pub called BEAVERS serves wine And cocktails and super nice owner.  I was, happy. Being solo traveller was fine. Great district. Shopping, malls, close orchard rd, national museum and so safe.,…,To be honest, the location of this property is okay, near to mrt and food. Looking at the reviews by others, my experience is really awful and as a frequent traveler, this is the worst property. First, the staffs are not attentive and helpful. During check in, i need to wait for more than 15 minutes because nobody is around. Apart from that, i drive to singapore this round. Even before i reach, i already message them but their reply is impatience and not really answering my question. When i ask about how to pay the parking, none of the staffs know and they only ask me to go and figure out myself. In the end, I got a 40 singapore dollar fine. Second, the air ventilation in the room is really terrible, the room is packed and filled with weird smell. The room design is quite packed, and weird, it is so stuffy that i can hardly breath in the room, the floor looks moldy too. My sincere advice, please look for other property as there are much more better property at this range of price.,…,Spent 1 night here as I had a long layover in Singapore was more than convenient as the hostel is near multiple shopping centers, food transport and entertainment. With surrounding areas little india and kamlong glam in walking distance the hostel has best location. Rooms where clean and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the hostel,· Don't book this place!!! The level of cleaning is very low! The pics of the hostel don't tell the true, a group of boys run the hostel, I kept the room because was impossible to find other place to stay because of the Singapore Formula1, during the check-in i just left my bags and went out, when i came back i saw My room was completely dirty, full of hair on the floor, hair in the bed, hair on the desk, i tried to talk with the manager but he is never around i ask to the staff many times to clean it but never happen, i have to clean the desk and the bed to able to use it, i've been in many hostels in my life around 50 maybe, and Atlantis Pods @ Bugis got the Top 3 about the more disgusting places that i ever seeing, i spend 3 days in a dirty room, i got allergy in my body, the, bathroom was disgusting!

PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore,4.5,128 reviews,#41 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,I had an excellent stay at Parkroyal Beach Road Serviced Suites. The room was big and spacious, was well equipped, and had very fast fibre broadband access with cable TV. Views of Kampong Glam and the city made waking up that much more enjoyable. Staff were pleasant and personable, both the reception staff and the chambermaids. Would definitely return again.,We stayed at ParkRoyal for a week with a family member who is temporarily living in Singapore for business.  The ParkRoyal room was well maintained, cleaned very well daily, nicely decorated, had excellent air conditioning, a full kitchen, multiple tvs, and a washer/dryer combo.  The hotel has wifi throughout and also provides a “handy phone” during your stay, which is a great bonus because it was convenient while exploring the city and international calls did not cost anything.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful.  There was free coffee and treats in the reception every day and a lovely pool area to sit and relax.  We liked the location in Kampong Glam area, which has a lot of restaurants and shops, and it is only a few minutes walk to the MRT.  We definitely, recommend staying at the ParkRoyal – it was a home away from home.,…,I travel to Singapore every year with a young family, and an apartment far better meets our needs than two hotel rooms. Over the years, I have stayed in several properties, and this is by some margin the best to date.  Some older reviews note that the pool was under renovation. This is now complete, and there is an attractive pool area with a good sized paddling pool for kids and a large pool suitable for length swimming  - I would guess about 25 meters. The gym/pool area is reached using lifts shared with an office block - it is a bit disconcerting seeing kids wearing swimming kit in a lift full of office workers, but no-one seemed bothered by it. The gym is very well equipped, with a good variety of up to date equipment.  The apartment was in good order - had clearly been, renovated fairly recently. Very nice bathroom and shower room, and a good kitchen, including washer-dryer. TV with a wide selection of cable channels, and high speed wireless internet are in the price. The wifi was upgraded during the stay, and is now very good ('up to' 70Mbit/s - I generally saw around 30 Mbit/s) where previously it could not sustain a video stream reliably.  For me, however, what stood out was the level of service. Housekeeping was very good - cleaning was done very well, and requests responded to promptly. Similarly, the reception staff were very helpful. It is clear that ParkRoyal takes care in the training of its staff, and this shone through for me.  The location is very good. About 10 minutes walk from Bugis Junction and Suntec City (two large malls with good supermarkets, food courts etc), and about 200 meters from the new Nicholl Highway MRT. It is also just across the street from Kampong Glam, which is full of trendy shops, bars and the like. You really don't need a shuttle service, unlike many of the other serviced apartment options in Singapore.  ParkRoyal is notably cheaper than some of its competitors, and if this is maintained, I will certainly be back next year, as the offering is excellent.  One very minor suggestion for improvement: the pool area could do with a few more sun loungers - at peak times they all get taken quite early in the day, and there is plenty of space to accommodate a few more.,…,We stayed here for a little more than a week in January, 2015 and found it to be a clean, convenient and very comfortable home-away-from-home. The suite was well-stocked and serviced every day (though we did have to ask twice for toilet paper) and the front desk staff were very pleasant and went out-of-their-way to help us. Beds were very comfortable and always plenty of hot water. We also had direct access to the pool and fitness facilities at the main hotel next door. The hotel is located directly opposite Kampong Glam and a short walk to both historical Raffles Hotel and the new developments at Marina Bay, so quite well located as well. We would certainly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a convenient and comfortable longer stay in Singapore.,From the moment we arrived we were stoked with our accommodation choice for our family holiday in Singapore. The 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom room was perfect for our young family, providing ample space for us to chill out at the end of very busy days. The room was cleaned to perfection, and while some aspects of the hotel are dating, the staff work hard to minimise the effect of these things. We were given a goody pack on arrival, including coffee, tea, biscuits, chips and bottled water - a very nice touch. The pool is unbelievable and the photos online don't give it justice. The kids loved swimming in the pool (although goggles are recommended, as with most swimming places in Singapore) and we enjoyed sipping Singapore Slings by the pool. All of the staff were very helpful and, extremely friendly. The suites are located at the back of the Parkroyal on Beach Road, so you get the benefits of a 5 star hotel, including awesome concierge service.  When booking our accommodation we were looking for a hotel with a bit of space, and we thought that by booking this hotel we might have been staying away from the action of the Marina and more popular Quay areas. However, this could not have been more untrue. The 10 minute walk to Suntec Towers meant that we could easily access groceries, shopping and top notch, but inexpensive restaurants (at both Suntec and Millenia). We were only a $7 cab ride from the other side of town, although we found ourselves walking around most of Singapore anyway.  We also had a beautiful view overlooking the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands building. While it is a bit of a distance from the Supertrees at the Gardens by the Bay, we were still able to see the light show at night (although being at the real thing is a must)  Another added bonus is the in room washing machine and dryer which meant that we returned home with very little washing to do.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to families as it ticks all of the boxes.,…",,,,494,83,100

Nevertheless, some more details infos:  Negative: - Booked a double pod, but the locker was the same size as the single pod. We were forced to sleep a backpack in our pod.  - The all security is weird, since the pin is even announced (using a paper) at the entrance door during the day time. Since backpack are stored there while you cannot checked, this  was not very comfy. However, it is Singapore and it all worked out smoothly . - Paying with card added 2% to the bill  Positive: - Very good location only 5min or less from the MRT station  - The self-made breakfast was simple,  but good (including even eggs),Upside: It is just 3 minutes walk from Kallang MRT (subway) station, and the hotel is surrounded by Chinese and Indian foods. The location is super convenient.  Downside:I booked a twin capsule but the bed size is just slightly wider then a super single bed, And we found out the aircon in our pod is not working, sweating for whole night.,We had a nice stay here. The staff was great! There was a lot of people in each room, so there was not really a place to put your big backpack. We got lockers for our smaller items though!   Our keycards stopped working our last night there so we had to spend 30 mins during the night to get our spacepod working. Breakfast is good 👍,Comfortable place with cheap price. The place is clean and the breakfast is enough. Capsule also clean and AC is working properly, they also provide you 1 towel per stay. Located near Kallang MRT and also can reach small supermarket for 5 minutes walk,1st time for me try Capsule Hostel at Singapore.

RedDoorz Plus near Lavender Street,4.0,8 reviews,#19 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Restaurant,,"Share, ,The rooms were very small as it was a budget hotel. Breakfast provided was also very limited, of which the pineapple served was stale. Also, just coz of some new large group which had come, they served boiled eggs. Which were not served earlier . Staff also not helpful. ,Located closer to lavender Jalang Besar with mostly bus stops within the vicinity. MRTs located approx 15 minutes of walking.  Ideal only as an alternate night stay as there's no functional restaurant within the hotel or within 10 minutes of walking. The restaurant on ground floor is not fully operational and doesn't have much of an option,It's not 5 star accommodation but it's close to the main attractions, within easy reach of transport and it's clean and well maintained. Rooms are small but perfectly OK for sleeping with flat screen TVs (few channels), fridge, kettle, tea and coffee provided, clean open shower with shampoo and soap provided, nice soft towels and a room safe and air conditioning. I have found they leave a key card in the holder to ensure the room is nice to come back to after a day out... nice! The hotel has a cafe and it has a good range of food at reasonable prices.

RedDoorz Hostel @ Kallang MRT,3.5,11 reviews,#164 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,I stayed in a deluxe cabin bed which was a capsule bed. The capsule was comfortable. It had a curtain, light, shelf and power point. The room had a fan and aircon. Unfortunately other guests in the room made a lot of noise and had conversations throughout the night. The location is handy being very close to a train station on the way from the airport. The front desk however is not open 24 hours so if you arrive after hours the front door will be locked with a sign on the door telling you to call a local phone number. ,Booked with agoda for double room, and agoda showed the rooms is a queen bed, private room picture, with title double room. Arrive and they told is booking 2 bed in a mixed dorm. Thus, wasting effort, wasting time dealing with agoda for manage a stay. They unable to upgrade us as there do not have any double room. Be careful if booking with agoda. Got no idea is agoda fault or is the supplier giving wrong information to agoda.,The room has no windows so it tends to have stuffy air. I was unlucky to have a loudly snoring dorm mate. The facilities look new but need some cleaning. Wifi is strong. The common area is really warm. They have a do it yourself laundry machine. Do not forget to buy laundry detergent if you are planning to use them. Request for a lower bunk bed. The beds make noises every time you move. Was not able to get sleep because of that and because of the snoring guest. The lockers they provided are spacious. For its price, you can find a better budget hostel. You will need to walk 5 to 7 minutes to the nearest train station. Cheap restaurants are a little bit far from this hostel. Breakfast was below average. Will not stay here next time I visit Singapore.,Good for lodgeing, clean, friendly Fair pricegood location, convient to go downtown and other visiting spot, Good breakfast, clean toilet, Claean bad, quiet and good decoration, colourfull environment. Fair price,First of all, I would like to say good things about this place. The bed is comfy & the convenient location. You paid what you get for.  However, the frustrated part for me would be the phone call. I tried to reach to you guys couple of times but no one is picking up. I thought is 24 hours customer service? Second, the noises. Please make sure the rules of hostel do gone through clearly. While we are asleep, there were some customer are shouting outside in the early of morning and it affects ALL of us inside the room trying to SLEEP. Third, the floor is DIRTY and WET inside the room.  Overall, I've been to a better hostel and is much more worth it than this. I would not coming back for sure.

There are small stores at the end of the street where one can buy grocery items. The coffee and milk tea per pack are just the right price and with varied selection. There are restaurants and the less expensive eateries offering chicken hainanese meal from S$4 to S$8. Taxi fare would depend on the taxi one is taking. The blue/white one is the regular taxi while the silver type one is the premium taxi that can charge upto S$22+ (from airport or Bugis area).,to me this hotel... service is very out and not friendly. got 1 staff ( old man) is very rude. iron is not provided. so you can get another hotel in this area as there are many hotels. great location bcz easy to get bus. so u can go wherever u want 😀. ,Good experience.

There are exaggerated instructions are all over the place, you will feel like you are an inmate. I hope they will have a QUIET SIGN instead of the instructions for there own good.

При заселении девушка с лобби не выдала полотенец. На вопрос о них ответила, что за полотенце будьте добры 10 долларов, 5 из которых вернут (т.е. депозит) а ещё 5 за пользование. Немного погрустив об этом на своей койке пришло в голову залезть на их страницу где английским по белому написано, что полотенца включены. Спустился в лобби, показал им эту нестыковочку, после чего незамедлительно получил полотенца. Ехали в Сингапур представляя какой он чистый в том числе от всякого рода обманщиков. Red Doorz первое впечатление испортили.  Следующий момент - завтрак. Я считаю, что тостовый хлеб и самый дешевый в мире маргарин это не завтрак. Это предлагается, запить кофе 3в1 или молоком. Также была при бронировании информация о том, что в течение всего дня в лобби доступны чай и кофе. Это не так. Можете лишь залить кипятком то, что сами и принесёте.   Дальше по обстановке. Фотографии на сайтах, естественно, действительности не соответствуют. Много грязи, много сломанного, даже постельное порвано! В номере кондиционер круглые сутки воссоздаёт атмосферу сибирской зимы. Объявления гласят, что выключать его или менять температуру строго запрещено - выселят. Попросили на ресепе хоть на пару градусов изменить,  мальчик пообещал передать. Естественно, ничего не изменилось.   А ещё, в комнате всю ночь храпел какой-то черт! Это, конечно не к хостелу претензия. Люди, если страдаете такой проблемой - не берите хостел! Понимаю, индивидуальные номера куда дороже, особенно в Сингапуре. Тем не менее, все остальные не должны страдать из-за вас.

Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,4.5,"3,583 reviews",#56 of 369 hotels in Singapore,,,"Share, ,I came here with my daughter for English high tea. There was plenty of food & free flow TWG tea.  Though not very luxurious in setting, this place has a good location that is in the bustling Orchard Road  shopping area.  The lobby lounge is quiet on a weekday afternoon, perfect for catch up with friends / tea break during shopping trips.,Team are awesome one has to question Marriott. How can you have one of the best bars in in Singapore with Crossroads and close it down? What’s much worse, even appalling, is the fact the the amazing staff who have made it so special have no idea what is going on or what the closure means for them! Appears the Marriott couldn’t care less about a group of people that have worked like crazy throughout the pandemic, not seeing family for over two years, for NOTHING. Marriott you should be ashamed!,I recommend it. Standards are very high. Probably due to COVID is not very affordable, I think it was slightly cheaper 2 years ago. Rooms are comfortable and clean, staff helpful and present. Room service well executed.,As you might know, in order to enter Singapore one first has to be quarantined for 14-days. Upon arrival at the airport you will go true the necessary inspections and PCR test. All I can say, very well organized, people are very friendly upon your arrival and same in the hotel. Daily calls from the Ministry of Manpower also very friendly and helpful staff. Download the app and daily report your health status. The highlight of the day is the food that is being served, in disposable plastic ""containers'' trays.(take your own cutlery) The hotel is randomly chosen for you. With this hotel located right in town center easy to order food in from shop or restaurant. 3 times you have to do your swap test and the last day of your stay another PCR. This is a beautiful hotel in a perfect, location, sad that one can not leave the room until the quarantine is over.  It would be better if trip advisor catered the questions for the current travel restrictions.,…,They offer an excellent variety of time pieces from the popular brands and their service was great! Big thanks to Kester from the tang plaza outlet for his excellent service and also sharing his strong knowledge on watches. Highly recommended for a visit if you are looking for nice time pieces 👍🏼","Green,Centrally Located",,,507,87,100
Ambassador Transit Hotel Terminal 2,4.0,739 reviews,#45 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free internet,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,A good and  very friendly advise to everyone - do not stay there, better go to terminal 3. Transit hotel at terminal 3 is nothing to shout but at least it is clean  and modern..... What we found in terminal 2,  I can not dare to describe as a hotel room - a cavernous, dirty hole with so many stains on floors, walls , ceiling that you`ll get a headache right after entering. The floor is so dirty I was afraid to touch it with bare feet, this resulted every time to don my sneakers when I ventured to step from the bedside - slippers are not provided naturally. The only unfortunate reason I found myself in its unhappy premises was the total lack of triple rooms in other terminals, so I was riveted to this choice or sleeping on the chair as an alternative. About sleep.... as the room, is windowless, it is SO scary to appear in complete darkness , especially if you know how dirty that darkness is. As a result we slept with a torch lamp on the whole night. Even with this torch I almost expected a  visitation  from some prehistoric roaches or even rats, or any other sort of bugs as the place looks quite capable of having SOME. Bathroom is of some suspiciously grayish color with disgusting cracks and stains, if you need a shower, do it quick and with closed eyes.  Some so called tea-coffee making facilities are nothing less than a broken kettle with spider web on the bottom. BBBBRRRRRRRRRR............  Conclusion - I am very unpleasantly surprised that such wonderful and comfortable airport as Changi allows this sort of disgrace to be called its transit facility. If you have to stay overnight in SIN airport, remember - GO to Terminal 3.,…,This hotel is really convenient and clean. I always book it when I have to catch connecting flights. The newer terminal has the best rooms but upgrades are happening to the other rooms in the terminals over time. It's hard to get into the newer terminal as you need to book so far in advance. The staff are not as friendly as other staff around the airport but I guess they have to talk to so many people they get tired and frustrated! It's also quite an affordable hotel. Always enjoy staying there. Highly recommended. The only thing that frustrated me on my last stay is a woman with three children decided to use the hallway as a playground as I was trying to get some sleep and I contacted the staff and they were quick to let her know that there are people sleeping and that it, wasn't a playground! So there you go, they do go above the call of duty too!,…,We booked this hotel for a 6 hour rest (6.30am-12.30pm)between flights overnight from melbourne to connect to Cambodia. The reception staff told us that there were renovations happening between 8am -5 pm, but we should be ok. Firstly, phone call at 7.30am awoke us, wrong room, next at 8.30am drilling, hammering, sounds of tiles or concrete dropping to floor, sounded like it was next door or above us. Unable to sleep, we left the room at 10.30am in disgust.. Why on earth could we  not have been placed in another room further away? We filled out survey form and let them know what a waste of $76 it was, and of course we were too trusting in going ahead with booking as we were desperate for sleep. Never again.,My husband and I stayed at this transit hotel for a few hours on our way home to Australia. We went straight to sleep upon arrival. When we awoke a few hours later we discovered faeces on the toilet just under the seat. Obviously the cleaners had not cleaned the toilet adequately. Staff cleaned the toilet and apologised but the hotel manager was not on site at that time. We asked for his email address and wrote to him about it - over a week later we have not even had a reply! We were shocked and appalled.,Big Tip!  Plan ahead.  They won't reserve a room for you until you have confirmed, booked flights.  And if you are changing airlines at Singapore after your layover, let your incoming airline set up a ""transfer"" to your next airline for your baggage (even if you start your trip two airports before Singapore).  I cannot stress this enough.  If you want to stay within the airport and be able to take advantage of their ""inside immigration"" hotel(s) or transit ""nap"" lounges you MUST set this transfer up ahead of time so you will not have to go through immigration (level two) to get your luggage.  If you do this in the middle of the night, when most ticket counters are not open, you will NOT be able to get a boarding pass for your outbound flight.  If you don't pick up your luggage, it will go to the airport police office and you will have to rely on the outbound airlines' ability to pick your luggage up for you whenever their counter does finally open.  If you elect to pick up your luggage you will be ""locked out"" of level three, where the airport hotels and nap lounges are, until your ticket counter opens (you will not be allowed back in without a boarding pass).  This is a nice airport with lots of cool stuff to see, but it is difficult to navigate if you don't know the ropes.  Contact me with any questions and learn from my mistakes!,…","Quiet,Modern",,,83,102,86

Room was big and spacious. Aircon was noisy though. Soundproof is so so. No warmer for pool so it was very cold to swim. More power outlets in the room would be good for families with lots of gadgets,Arrived at 2pm & fortunately our room was ready (Room 1402).  Check-in was fast cause not a lot of people. When we came down at 3pm, it was pretty packed at the lobby.  Hotel was peaceful & quiet. We had a very good sleep. Far East was just beside and shopping for food & snacks was convenient.  Breakfast buffet was great. Venue was spacious. It has Prata with chicken curry, dim sum, western, etc..  1 very little minus point was that the plug is not beside the bed and we have to charge it beside the TV. ,Nice place for family or friends staycation with bigger than average rooms in orchard area. Will probably plan to stay here again in the coming months with friends especially when celebrating an occasion,York hotel is what I would call a hotel that is often understated and one of the rare few hotels that would meet and address all guest's concerns.

Changi Cove,4.0,483 reviews,#125 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Good location hotel that surrounded by nature. There are some huge and tall trees in the hotel area. Near to the beach club, boardwalk, (haunted) old changi hospital, changi village.  Restaurant is quite decent but the breakfast was to simple and worth to skip and find it outside if expect better breakfast to cheer up your day. Room quality is fine with the price range, but during high season can feel the lack of manpower to clean up the room as we found that the floor inside the room was very dusty.,Upon arrival, greeted by their friendly door man. Checked in was quick and easy by their friendly reception manager Alisya.   Room was clean and quiet. Just once in awhile you can hear their cleaner's trolley passing by.   Had my dinner at the in-house restaurant, food was tasty. But it seems like no waiter/waitress is around. Couldn't get anyone to refill my water.   Checked out by their reception staff Siara. She was friendly and helpful.   Overall was a good stay. ,Room is clean but there's only one chair and a bean bag, besides the bed.  The main gripe is the service. The assistant manager was cold, gruffy and definitely didnt make us feel welcome even though we were just collecting the breakfast. I definitely felt as if I was a school kid collecting homework from my teacher!,Location was not really fun as there is not much to do even tried to go to the beach but was blocked by fences. Staff at the reception looks dead and not welcoming and the one wearing the polo t should tuck in his shirt and check his name tag was placed properly. Staff is either overworked (saw the guy Leonard from I check in till checkout) or just not right to be in the service industry but we paid not to get treated like we owe them money. Food overpriced for laksa and mini samosa. $175  comes with no fridge and remote that is spoiled even ants on the rug. Will not recommend to spend here as there are other places worth your money that I have visited as seems like a budget hotel worth $90. This is my honest opinion and will not come again.,We stayed here for one night so we could more easily access Ubin but we left feeling really ripped off. The breakfast was terrible and the room was very basic for the price we had to pay. But the worst thing was the bed was not a standard length- it was much shorter which meant my husband’s feet hung off the end of the bed.","Quiet,Modern",7149,Tripadvisor,11,3,50
ST Signature Tanjong Pagar,5.0,55 reviews,#2 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Stayed in this hoyel for a while. The location is prime, with walkable access to almost all hot spots in the city. Staff's very friendly and the room is very well equipped and comfortable for the price and size.  If you're a single or couple travellers or just looking for a place to stay this can be it. I can highly recommend it if you need a long term lodging as well. The room's very well furnished and for the facilities they offer this becomes a very competitively priced housing in this prime area,Located at Tanjong Pagar and also near many of the famous restaurants in the area, this place is a 10 out of 10 for the location. St Signature is also extremely clean, cosy, well designed and has a very nice ambience! The bed is super comfortable and the toilets come with very nice smelling and good quality shampoo. The self check in is my favourite thing about St Signature as there is more privacy. Furthermore, the door lock is digital so you do not have to carry your card around when you go out, super convenient! For the price, this place is absolutely worth it. I will definitely return.,I stayed at the ST signature at Tanjong pager for 2 week in January 2021 and my experience was fabulous. This hotel is close to multiple hawker centers, including the famous Maxwell, award-winning Amoy and the good old chinatown food center. Each meal is unique, tasty and affordable. Since my stay was during the pandemic, the hosts have been working diligently to make sure every guest has a comfortable and safe stay. Temperature is checked each and every time you leave and enter, which may sound a lot of work but make me feel secure. The only thing I would suggest the hotel to consider is to expand the fridge. The entire hotel shares one fridge and it's always food. I tried hard to find myself a sport of bottled milk and didn't have much problem with it, but I imagine for people, who do want to cook, they might have a hard time storing the ingredients.,…,This is my second time with ST Tanjong Pagar, but third time with ST.   Its my getaway when I need time to myself. :) TP is always a great location, with easy access to great food and whatever you may need. ;)  The place is modern and clean, just that kitchen was offlimits when I was there due to covid.   If anything I could change about it? I wished the walls were thicker! I like to play music ;),First time and stayed here to get some time alone. The place was clean and cozy. The TV provides services such as Netflix, Youtube etc. for your own entertainment as you spend time in the room.  Really random but the shower gel was super fragrant!!!  The only downside was that the max temp. for aircon was 20 degrees which can get rather cold. The noise from the road and construction was rather unpleasant. Other than that it was a good stay!",,3912,Agoda.com,940,103,100
Hilton Garden Inn Singapore Serangoon,4.0,"1,118 reviews",#121 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,Malay,"Share, ,I staying here for SHN 21days, satisfactory for the room cleanliness, room amenities provided are very useful,  staff are very friendly and helpful. Efficient for all the requests, 3meals a day were very punctual to be sent to the room outside, even call delivery/ family send item from outside, the hotel staff will send the item to my room very fast. Friendly hotel for those mummies who had to keep their breast milk into freezer, hotel had provide too. I can say that I very lucky to be assigned to this hotel for my quarantine period.,After recent stay I have mixed feelings. Here pros and cons:  Pros - location, cleanliness, delicious food, friendly staff Cons - Rooms are not new, rooms itself narrow, rooms facing a temple you may hear sound in the mornings  In general, possible to stay for business or leisure trip as well.,While this Hilton might not be the fanciest hotel(and actually a Garden Inn edition of the hotel chain), it sure feels like a sanctuary of comfort and basic luxury given what it is surrounded by in the chaotic Little India district of Singapore  LOCATION: Excellent location (if you like a huge selection of cheap food and drinking options) in Little India and steps away from the Metro station.  DINE + DRINK: This hotel houses one of the Hidden gems of the city! They actually have a cool Terrace restaurant on the 8th floor with lovely views of the skyscrapers and chilled out location next to the pool. The lobby level snack bar and store is also a good place to grab a quick snack  ROOM: We stayed in 1320, so this review is based on that; VIEW: Lovely View of the charming Shophouses, in the Little India Quarter and the mesmerizing Skyline at a distance ; SIZE: Reasonably spacious room with a nice sitting area next to the Window; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Lovely cosmetics from CRABTREE & EVELYN  FACILITIES: Compact Gym with a Full range of weights and Cardio machines - including  a good Cable Machine. The pool on the 8th Floor is great for a quick dip or a nice aqua workout  SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all my needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of.   HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free high speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Big Plasma TV screen dishing out dozens of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple languages,…,We spent 3 nights in this hotel at the end of January. We were initially placed in the annex building facing the temple. The room was very clean and comfortable. We were awoken at 5am by the noise from the temple. Then again awoken at 7am from the temple. After getting more sleep we asked to switch rooms to the main building facing away from the temple. The front desk was very quick to help us with those arrangements. After that switch was made we had a wonderful rest of our stay.  This hotel is very clean and in great condition. My only comment would be to avoid rooms facing the temple if you want to avoid early morning noises.,Is the hotel gonna stay open after 7th April. I made a reservation and am thinking if I wanna cancel. I’ve tried calling the hotline but I can’t get through at all. I’m hoping I can get a reply here so yea...","Mid-range,Family",,,237,40,98

You will be even happier if advised on your yummies by Hafiz, who assembled my amazing coconut and shrimp based soup, taking care to add the right balance of chilli, tofu, fish paste and veg. The other staff, Pamela, Nara, Lynn and Ben, quietly glide around, restocking the tasty snacks and clearing up. Outside you enjoy the warm breeze, watching for the soaring eagles and listening to the chirruping of the mynahs. One or two may hop down to see if you leave a crumb! Meanwhile, drinks are complimentary, the service great and the ambience superb. Thank you, Hafiz and team. Maggi and Norris Millar. ,We first booked this hotel in 2019 for a 1 night stopover on our way back to the U.K. we decided to book it again this year on our way out to Australia and have a longer stay. The hotel has great facilities, 2 pools and a gym. It also had 3 restaurants to suit a number of tastes. It is also a 5 minute walk from the beach so ideal for families. Okay, you are not in the City but you are close to the airport, with a free transfer service and, if you are trying to avoid Coronavirus, it is away from the crowds.  You can book directly through Far East Hospitality and if you register you get a discount.  In the hotel, if you pay by MasterCard you get a 15% discount. I used my Mongo Card so had no fees plus the discount.,We had a 17 hour layover in Singapore between flights. Seeing as sleeping in Changi airport is impossible we needed the cheapest accommodation nearest to the airport. Hotels right at the airport are expensive and this one provides a free bus from and back to the airport. The room was awesome. Nice and quiet with a massive shower head above the bath that has the best pressure. Our only issue is we only had 1 towel for two people. I didn't bother ringing reception to report it as we were limited for time in the morning when this was realised. The gym was amazing. Floor 5, with great equipment and views. My son went and couldn't stop raving about it.,We spent our first 2 nights downtown Singapore using the MRT to get around. We wanted a different experience on our last night and chose this neighbourhood for a more relaxed visit. The location of this comfortable hotel is steps from a beach and park, a small ferry to other islands,  a hawkers market which was sadly closed on Tuesday when we were there, also a street lined with restaurants and small shops and real people. The hotel itself has nice facilities, we only used the rooftop pool and the free airport shuttle the next morning, make arrangements for your seat on the shuttle as soon as you arrive, it goes hourly. We thought the hotel was good value and the Changi village as refreshing change from downtown Singapore.,It's a convenient spot with the shuttle service and several eateries nearby. The beach is a 5-minutes walk away and you can rent a bicycle near the entrance of the beach to ride along. A recreation club just opposite the hotel provides more options of fun activities during stay. Room is spacious and clean, shower is great and bathtub is wide. Toiletries provided were of good quality. There's also an ironing board and iron in room. The operator who picked up my call for bathrobes was friendly and efficient.  The lifts were in need of an upgrade though. It was a little inconvenient when the lift was flashing 'Overload' when it was not even 50% filled and definitely way below the maximum weight limit. The line for the concierge counter could be better placed to avoid confusion. , Nonetheless, all is well and would consider coming back~,…","Bay View,Mid-range",,,61,2,76

Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,4.5,"4,354 reviews",#53 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Hindi","Share, ,I was flying in for a long weekend in Singapore, and chose this hotel specifically for its close proximity to the shopping and Somerset MRT station. Of course, it helped that H.I. Orchard City Centre was highly rated by previous TA reviews. But as we all know, everyone's experience is bound to be different, so I was very keen to see for myself what all the fuss was about and whether it would be worth an eight hour plane trip both ways.  My booking was made through H.I's website and the package I booked (King size, inclusive breakfast and broadband) did not require a prepayment. From the outside, the building is non-descript, but step inside the lobby and things change. Your eye is drawn to two fully lit crystal chandeliers and an enormous blue oriental rug running the length of, the lobby - first impression is one of luxuriousness, this is definitely not your average H.I. Check in service was both friendly and efficient - a credit card deposit was given and I was handed an access card for my sixth floor room.  On entering, I noticed the light streaming in through the window. Drawing back the curtains you see a sea of green from the park beyond.This park is in fact the back garden of the Singaporean president's official residence. Getting back to my room. The proportions are generous and there is no prospect of feeling claustrophobic here. Overall, the feeling is very fresh and clean. The colour scheme and decor is warm with contemporary earthy brown tones as seen in the patterned carpet, timber furniture, and block-out curtains. Business travellers can go about their work on a decent size desk with an adjustable padded office chair. To relax, there's also a nice armchair with ottomon and sidetable to take in the park views with your afternoon tea or evening cocktail. The bed and padded headboard is huge, and more importantly very comfortable indeed. A nice touch offered by this H.I. is a pillow menu from housekeeping! But I was satisfied with what was already there (2 x soft and 2 x firm pillows) and so declined to get more pillows.  There is stocked mini bar fridge beneath the TV; the prices are not that much more expensive than what you'd pay outside. Tea and coffee making facilities and clean glasses are also provided. Just note: there are no mini milk portions provided, just powdered creamer, which is not really suited for tea-making.  Storage space is really ample with large sized wardrobe with plenty hangers; you'll also find an electronic safe, iron and ironing board and two waffle fabric type bathrobes - very comfortable. For entertainment, you have a large wall-mounted LCD TV with about twenty channels on offer including news, sports, documentaries etc. I didn't really find anything appealing, but then again I was not spending much time indoors, so no matter. For broadband connection, H.I. offers packages starting from daily rates. My rate included broadband, but this turned out to be the biggest disappointment of my stay. After the first day, the connection was decidedly patchy and seemed to work best early mornings and late evenings. During the day it would often just cut out. I would say that it only worked around 50% of the time I wanted to connect. Signal strength never exceeded 3 bars when it was working and was mostly just one or two bars. Since I was on holiday it didn't really matter, but I imagine a businessman would not be of the same thinking.  The bathroom was small but not overly so; but it was literally shiny clean and well supplied with linen. The toiletries are H.I. branded and in copious supply: shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, body wash, soap, as well as those often forgotten items like toothpaste, tootbrush etc. I found the quality of the toiletries slightly disappointing; its OK, but nothing to rave about. Still, like everything else, at least it was replenished daily. Overall, I would say that this smart contemporary styled room is impeccably fresh and clean - top marks to housecleaning.  Since Singapore is a foodies paradise I mostly ate out, and only ordered room service once: a satay selection and club sandwich with what else, a Singapore Sling cocktail! Service was slow (45 minutes), but worth the wait. Another gastronomic point worth mentioning is H.I's amazing buffet breakfast, unquestionably the best spread I've seen anywhere. This being Singapore, I was not surprised to see not one but three choices on offer: western, oriental and Indian. Of course, you're welcome to mix it all up as I did every morning. But it does get busy though, so plan to go either before 8 or after 9:30 (breakfast hours are 6:00 - 10:30).  There were other facilities at H.I. which I never got to use such as the pool, gym, bars, and Indian restaurant, but I would be surprised if they were not of high quality like everything else here.  My impressions of this H.I. were very positive. A few of the highlights: the stunning lobby; the great room and the terrific buffet breakfast. Not so good was the broadband connection. For about AUD$300 per night I thought H.I. was excellent value and would recommend this hotel to those looking for 4 star quality accommodation with easy access to the Orchard Road shopping district.

Just don't hesitate, if you go in S'pore, book this hotel !!! ,I travel a lot on business, therefore, the quality of hotel rooms and staff are very important to me.  The room in this hotel was the most peaceful I've ever stayed in.  Complete silence!  No noise from the hallway, street or other rooms.  The doors have little doorbells, so there's no rapping in the morning by houskeeping trying to service other rooms while you're trying to sleep. The silence is just amazing.  So amazing that I slept 17 straight hours and missed my first day of meetings!  I didn't set the alarm because I'm such a light sleeper and knew I'd be awakened by all the normal hotel noise.  Ha!  Not at this hotel! In addition to the above, the service is amazing.  There was a small problem with the bed sheets which was corrected as soon as I reported it.  Not only did, they immediately correct this problem, the manager, along with an assistant, tracked me down during lunch to personally apologize and give me her business card in the event there was any other difficulty during my stay.  Due to a misunderstanding, they thought I had a problem with my mattress.  While I was out at meetings, THEY REMOVED MY MATTRESS AND REPLACED IT WITH A BRAND NEW ONE!  Wow. This hotel is not quite as large and elaborate as some of the others in Singapore, however, if you want a great room, great service and a fair price, this is the place.,…,I stayed at the hotel when the rest of the city was booked solid. It is not the most flash place, but the service is good and it is clean. The pool on the roof is great and you can get served meals by the pool. Great place to relax after a dy in the city or at a conference. The broadband access is non existant. The buffet breakfast is one the best in SNG. Not my first choice of hotels but certainly a place to stay if you want peace and quiet. 5 minute walk to MRT. ,We stayed here with our two kids recently and thoroughly enjoyed our stay with this hotel. The service was fantastic, and the pool on the roof of the hotel was excellent. The breakfast was well appointed and service again was good.

Was given a spacious room with a large desk, complimentary water and an ensuite toilet (with towels, shower foam and shampoo available. No soap though!)

Would come again! Got my lunch at the social cafe at Level 4 :) Quiet cafe which supports people with special needs. Food was reasonable in taste and price :),I booked once then I booked again and extended my stay. Very friendly and kind staff Nice food at the restaurant. You can enjoy your food or coffee at the terrace. Very central location, bus stop locate just outside and the train station is just 2 minutes walking.,From the location of the hotel (is in the heart of Singapore), to the room (is clean and the city is overlooking, the toilet is complete with all I need, the towels provided were so clean, and all other equipment inside my room are all useful.

Room 808 under the name Mohamed. Bino was very helpful and friendly. Property was clean. Had lovely stay. Will definitely come back again for the exceptional service from Bino.,We stayed there for 10 weeks and the staff were all friendly and helpful throughout.   The place is a bit dated but they offered us one of the renovated rooms so it wasn’t too bad. We could tell that Housekeeping, especially Cynthia, tired to make the most out of the limited resources.   We initially had some problems with the WiFi but Front Office installed a dedicated WiFi router in our room that resolved the issue.","Centrally Located,Family",,,321,59,100

Hmlet Cantonment,4.5,64 reviews,#38 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid private parking on-site,English,"Share, ,I get to stay here for 7 nights with my boyfriend and the experience has been nothing but amazing. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful; the environment is cozy, comfortable and modern with all the facilities that may not be available in a hotel, i.e., the communal kitchen. The location is awesome as well. It is within walking distance from practically everything, including the seaside Harborfront area.   We got the smallest room which is spacious enough for 2-person if you are used to the standard apartment size of a room. My only minor gripe is the lack of partition in bathroom between the shower area and the toilet. There is only a slim glass panel on the side that is the closest to the shower head and it's not wide enough to stop water from splashing onto the rest of, the bathroom.,…,I stayed in a large size room for 2 weeks for business trip, the room decoration attracted me to choose this apartment. Staffs are very nice and helpful, they told me this new hotel established for 3 months only. The location is convenient, only 10 mins walking distance to the nearest shopping mall and Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market. However, as the room do not have table for work, the high chair is too high for me to use laptop on the kitchen table. One thing suggest to improve is there are no space to put toiletry stuff in the washroom, this is a bit inconvenient. The place is very nice for holiday but not for business trip. You can use the big lobby anytime and they provided free beer for you to relax and Chi chi-chat with you friend. This hotel is highly recommended and will, visit again.,…,Besides the unbeatable location. It's a unique feeling of being home away from home. Outstanding design and the extreme friendly and professional people was making all the difference. Imagine being asked if you would like to sit down first and enjoy a tea or a cold beer from the tap when you first arrived late evening! And that’s not because I’m a colleague visiting from HK, but how everyone is treated. It's like staying over at a friend's place rather than a boutique hotel. It's like a little Oasis in the middle of town. Well done Hmlet Cantonment!,The most impressive thing about this place was the cozy, boutique and chic feel you get. It's spacious (for singapore standard) and the best part was the staff were super friendly! Imagine being asked if you would like a coffee when you first arrived, hell yea! That's the best kinda welcome! It's as if you are being welcome to someone's home. Oh and the FREE flow beer from the tap! Would definitely come back many time. Perfect for travellers who like some quiet space to work on your laptop. Oh and that little backyard was soooo cozy!!!,I recently stayed here for work, I received a complimentary upgrade to the Extra Large Room which I would recommend. The property is impeccable and the staff could not do more to help and always greet you with a smile. The complimentary WiFi is very good and the rooms are beautiful, as is the entire property. It's a short 5 minute walk to Outram station and there are a couple of local eating spots across the road. It's also short walk to some shops and there is complimentary coffee and beer in the communal room. Highly recommended and would more than happily stay here again.",,,,220,18,96
Jude's Homestay,5.0,1 review,#193 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,free parking,Changi Airport,comfortable with free wifi,East Coast Park,free parking,WIFI is free,East Coast Park,Sofern man die eher private Atmosphäre eines B&B mag und auf die Infrastruktur eines Hotels keinen Wert legt, eine sehr empfehlenswerte Adresse !  Wir verbrachten 5 Nächte in dem im Erdgeschoß gelegenen Zimmer mit kleiner Terrasse zum Garten und haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Das Zimmer ist geräumig, auch das Badezimmer mit Dusche hat eine sehr angenehme Größe, Wasserdruck und -temperatur waren stets in Ordnung, positiv ist direkte Belüftungsmöglichkeit über ein kleines Fenster. Im Zimmer gibt es sowohl Air Condition als auch einen Deckenventilator, Sauberkeit des Zimmers und des gesamten Hauses hervorragend! Donald und Judy sind äußerst nette und freundliche Gastgeber, das Frühstück ist gut und abwechslungsreich. WLAN vorhanden.  Das Haus liegt in einer sehr schönen, ruhigen und, gepflegten Wohngegend, in der man sich selbst abends und in der Nacht sicher fühlt, was zu erwähnen ist, dass es doch in einer gewissen Distanz zum Stadtzentrum liegt. Bushaltestelle der Linie 42, die zur MRT-Station Kembangan führt, liegt in unmittelbarer Nähe, bis zum Zentrum dauert es etwa 30 bis 40 Minuten, am Abend etwas länger, wenn man nicht das Glück hat, bei Kembangan gleich den Bus zu erwischen (Intervalle etwa 20 Minuten). Vom Flughafen mit dem Taxi etwa 15 bis 20 Minuten, Kosten des Taxis etwa SGD 17.-. Wenn einen die relativ lange Fahrtdauer zum und vom Zentrum nicht stört, eine wirklich empfehlenswerte Unterkunft  und im übrigen auch eine relativ preisgünstige Alternative zu den Hotels in Singapur. Sollten uns unsere Wege wieder einmal nach Singapur führen, werden wir auf alle Fälle wieder bei Donald und Judy übernachten!!  PS: In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es keine Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, LTN Food Village in 936 Upper East Coast Road ist in etwa 10 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen; war unserer Meinung nach von der Qualität um einiges besser als etliche in diversen Reiseführen hochgelobte Food Courts im Zentrum ! Und nebenbei bemerkt um einiges billiger .. absolut authentisch und untouristisch !!,…",,,,99,5,61

It was right in the heart of Boat Quay where you can step outside and immediately be surrounded by shops and restaurants along the waterway. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It was in a safe part of town so we felt comfortable walking around even during the nighttime. It's definitely a great deal if you're staying in Singapore and looking to save some money.,The staff at this hostel are very friendly, and offered a lot of advice on where to go in the city. But unfortunately the rooms was very tight, with not much room to move to get anything from your bag if someone else was stood beside you. The air conditioning was non existsant, and the small tight capsule you slept in made the place feel like an oven. The toilets and showers are border line disgusting. The shower is less than a meter away from the toilet, as well as the sink. You could be stood in someone's pee whilst you shower and the toilet paper was wet as it is so close to the shower. This place is in a great location, and the free breakfast was toast/jams/choco flakes milk, and free coffee. But the bathroom situation was not pleasant at all and would put me off staying, here again. ,…,The hostel is expensive for the poor service. The bathroom is ALWAYS wet, dirty and disgusting. Is small and uncomfortable.  If you wanna use it you are wet everywhere and you can’t use shoes there. Is small and dirty. The toilet and the bottom is full of water and hair in each corner.  The staff don’t help with anything and they are arrogant and don’t say you nothing about the place. The check in is at 3pm, too late.  You have to pay for the towel and also deposit for the key. The breakfast is just a piece of bread and tee or coffee, nothing like in the pictures, also, you have to wash your dishes. There’s no place to be like with a sofa or common area, just the room with 15 more people. The only positive thing is the location of the place, nothing else. I don’t recommend this, place, expensive, poor and bad service and dirty and disgusting. I’m the pictures you can see the bathroom always wet, go to the toilet ist a nightmare.,…,Singapore is expensive so opted for a capsule as I often use hostels. I stayed in an all female room, very quiet and bed was clean and comfortable. The showers and bathroom area did not feel clean at all. In the 3 days, I only had hot water once. My biggest issue was there was no comfortable common areas that encouraged guests to connect. It was an isolating stay and not social.   There is no lift and it has many stairs, so pack light or be prepared to pack your bag up.   Boat Quay is close to the MRT and you can walk to Merlion Park easily. Location is in a touristy strip of bars and restaurants which should have made it easy to go out with ppl. Overall, affordable but not social. ,My third time in Singapore and I wanted to try this place after seeing very beautiful photos on Agoda. Reality is completely different... this is a “wannabe” cool hostel but at the end is a place full of rules with very short hours reception time, toilet are “self cleaning “ since shower, sink and w.c. are all together in 1 square meter of toilet. Hostel is well above average price of any other hostels in Singapore so I was expecting much more. Bad general maintenance... some items in toilet are broken. Location is nearby Merlion Park, but even if you take a room in Chinatown, you will not be so far... so is not point to pay more for this location. Toilets and stairs messy, with rubbish, dirty fridge.....and the breakfast (very poor) room is sooo small and  very busy at morning, time. Anyway I would not go back there.... and also I had to ask to change my bed sheet as were used by previous guest... but they pretended they were cleaned.... maybe they had just remouve some hair from it....also also duvet cover was filthy.... smell of kitchen from restaurants in the area in the stairs. Apart from this, dorm was cool and ok to sleep. Not value for money.,…","Centrally Located,Budget",,,651,92,100

ibis budget Singapore Sapphire,3.5,348 reviews,#161 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,When we first booked this hotel we decided to go for it because it was 70 SGD at agoda, and it was for a superior room. When we got into the small room that they called superior I was very dissapointed and went right back to the reception to ask if they had given us the wrong type of room. The only answar was that "" That is our superior room, our standard rooms are superior"". What a joke! If I had paid the full amount that they normally took for the room (around 140 SGD!!) I would have been very angry, but for the price we paid I just left it at that. I can summarize the hotel like this: NEGATIVES: Hair everywhere around in the room, bed and bathroom; Very dusty (and I asked for an allergy friendly room); You have to turn on a switch or you will not get to shower in hot water;, No ""Welcome"" greeting when arriving at the reception; There is toothbrushes, but no toothpaste for them, what's up with that logic?; Poor information about emergency exits; No fridge in room; You have to shower right next to the toilet so everything gets wet; And of course this is a red light district so I would never go here with children. POSITIVES: Kettle, coffee and tea in room; 2 toothbrushes and shower caps; DVD player and flat screen TV, safety lock on door; Make-up table with mirror in room; Hairdryer; Aircondition.  I would not stay here again.,…,Stayed 1 night due to flying into Singapore after midnight and not wanting to waste much money on a small stay, The lady at the front counter was very pleasant and friendly.  Geylang Red light district.... We didn't know what we were getting into, but when we went for a walk around at 2am to find some food and drink we had no issues and didn't feel unsafe at all.   MRT was a bit of a walk 10-15mins, buses close by and two 7/11 within 2 minutes of hotel door.  Very good hotel for the small price we paid, for short stays I would return to this hotel.,Family Room - one single bed - one queen size bed - US$ 159.54 (inclusive of tax & other charges) (booked online - Agoda.com) - maximum of three persons  Pros: - Cheap - Room is clean. - Bathroom is clean. - Bed is comfortable. - For ladies, there's a hair dryer inside the drawer. (So, no need to bring one.) - Friendly Staff - Near MRT Kallang Station (10-minute walk) - Near Bus Stop (5-minute walk) - Lots of restaurants nearby (food price: S$ 3 - 25) (water price: S$ 1.20 - 2) - 7-11 store nearby - Fruit market nearby  Cons: - hotel is located at Red-Light District - Family room is small for three persons. - Cabinets are small. - No shampoo and conditioner - No slippers - Use of wifi is not free (S$ 15 for 2 hours) - Elevator is small.,The hotel is very dirty : the walls are disgusting , the carpet also , hairs in the bed, dirty sheets , hairs in the bathroom ,  dried paper on the ground in the toilet. The smell in the room was unbearable! And impossible to open the window ... The hardware is useless : the hot water was not working, the shower head was in a very bad condition. Staff are not friendly, they are only interested by money and not customer satisfaction . Staff english is very poor ( the worst I have had in Singapore) . And do not count on the Wifi: it is not working . And finally little surprise : you will pay more than the price shown on Booking.com (for me) arriving at the hotel. Regarding the area, allow 15 minutes to reach the metro. Very few restaurant nearby.,Stayed at the family room for three nights. The room is small than expected, it fits ecxatly a queen size and a single beds plus a small immovable cubicle in the middle of the beds. However, it fits well for 3 and slightly enough for 4. Im impressed with the cleanliness of the room especially the bathroom, it looks newly furbished and clean! The hotel is also quite convinient as it locates js a junction away from the nearest bus stop which buses can be taken to get to bugis, chinatown or even harvourfront; mrt station is slightly further away-approximately 15 mins walk. The only down point is tht it is located right in the middle of the red light district. It is.fine in the morning but at night the place nearby is kinda scary, many standing at the roadsides to invite customers., I strongly discourage female travellers to stay there unless u are travelling with male family members or friends. But im glad tht none of the 'girls' were infront of the hotel but mainly gathered around the other junctions. Overall it is a value for money, but if u are worried about the fact of its location, maybe u can consider some other options.,…",Budget,5552,ZenHotels.com,59,7,77

Food shops are also around for late night snacks, there is even a supermarket within walking distance. Went here with my friends and we had no trouble at all checking in and out, staff were all friendly and eager to help when we ask for assistance. There are attraction tickets available in the hotel so if you want to go somewhere on a whim its easy access discount tickets will surely help.

Hotel Classic by Venue,3.5,161 reviews,#165 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,A staff by the name of Kenneth (chubby,wears glasses) who is manning the front desk made the experience of checking in, extremely terrible. His condescending tone was extremely rude and unpleasant. Firstly, it was his inability to explain things properly to first timers like me who rarely visit hotels.  When asked if 5 people from the same household were allowed to stay in, he has unfortunately answered in the most condescending way possible, that it almost sounded as though he was looking down on me and my family.I can never forget that tone, because it was the most rudest thing I've experienced when it comes to front line service. He raised his tone ever so slightly as I was informing him about the government rule of allowing 5 people from the same household, and he answered, with a condescending tone once more. Extremely displeased with his service. Regardless of what grade a hotel is, I think the most important thing is to treat everyone with respect. Unfortunately,  Kenneth, you have ruined the day for me and my family.,…,I had a one night stay here while moving house. It was exactly what I needed - quiet and comfortable room, no frills. Was really pleased with the excellent shower including rain shower option and decent toiletries.   Check in is basic but complies with Covid-19 rules.

There were even USB charging points so we didn't need an adaptor.  They provided water and lovely green apples. It looks newly refurbished.  They happily offered a late checkout and let us leave our suitcases there for the day.  Would highly recommend this hotel.,Staffs are very friendly, good location a 24 hrs food stall just around the corner. An airport bus can reach there.  But the room is very small, it could just anywhere in Singapore.   Also the sound proof was so poor. Sleeping in bed feel like sleep on street.,It was a wonderful stay: kind stuff (we were upgraded two times, permitted to stay 3 hours more after chech-out), always with sincere smile and helpful: if it is raining, they provide you with umbrella. The chief manager and all team do pay attention to their guests. The room service is at top: fridge, TV, kettle with tea-coffee set, free water and apples. Towels are changed everyday (you may ask to change linen also). In the majority of rooms, there is no window and it can disturb your stay, but for this price it's the best offer. The swimming pool is situated in the other hotel ans you should cross the backyard to get there (and it's always smelly and dirty), but it's clean and with no much chlorium. And no big crowd. The hotel is situated a bit far from the metro station, but, the bus to the center stops in 50 meters.

All toiletries were provided (body soap, shampoo, shower cap, sanitary bag, toothbrush and toothpaste, body lotion etc).

The place itself is very small with only 3 dorms. Very clean and the staffs there are super friendly.  Toilets are clean but a bit small and lacks hanging hooks. Overall it was a pleasant stay with the exception of the first night where I had a room-mate who snores like a bear...",,,,771,122,100
Grand Pacific Hotel,3.5,"1,433 reviews",#162 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"Chinese, Malay","Share, ,This hotel was ridiculously dirty. Duvets were stained and smelled like dirty armpits. Carpets had massive stains and they retained hefty deposits without prior notice. Flea bites!

Quality of the foods and cooking is one of worse place. Most foods Court or small restaurants will cook much better foods than Sun cafe.  Service is quite good.,Great location in Singapore. Walking distance to many great food spots, like Arab Street, or a quick taxi/grab ride to China Town. Price was heavily discounted when we stayed, and it looks like several floors were being re-furbished. It needs it. Gym is like a closet. Pool is ok, but also needs some work.,We stayed here in 2009 and were happy to stay here again so arranged a 5 night stay from 11th March to 16th. Very disappoint as the hotel needs a lot of work. Most floors were not in use as apparently floor maintainence was taking place. The rooms decor seemed very tired, the room itself was big enough and clean enough  although bathrooms were very small an needing updated. With the corona virus I must admit they were 100% on top of things, our temperatures were taken before we actually checked in there was also hand sanitiser on counter for everyone to use.  Every time we went to dining room our temperature was taken again. Well done for being so good at that. We felt the meals were not brilliant breakfast had full English and continental but have had better in a lot of other, hotels.we ate in the dining room twice but opted to dine out the other nights.

Studio M Hotel,3.5,"3,006 reviews",#164 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid private parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Korean, Malay","Share, ,Good location with many accessible F&B outlets . Friendly staff. Modern rooms and affordable price. Convenient location, with bus stops and a few MRT nearby. Walking distance to clark quay and chinatown. Not forget to mention the staff there, very helpful when we asked some good restaurants recommendations.,My girlfriend and I stayed at Studio M last year. We had been there before and liked the location and staff. We stayed in a 'funky' loft style room.  In the morning, as I descended to visit the bathroom, a tread on the staircase broke and I fell, directly on my head, breaking 6 vertebrae, 3 ribs, my sternum and my left clavicle. My girlfriend, God bless her, rang staff, ambulance, police... the CIA (I'm not sure, I was kind of in blur land)... I was immediately taken to hospital. That was 9 months ago and I am yet to hear from the hotel or their insurers. I did get a bowl of fruit from them while I was in hospital... but it's not easy crunching apples with a broken neck. To date: NOTHING! If a vital staircase can be so shoddily built, imagine how dangerous other hotel components, are- bacteria in pool? Salmonella in kitchen? Elevators stopping mid floor. I can only imagine.  But thank God, despite losing over 100.00 bucks, I am still alive and can finally walk. I am grateful for that blessing but I hope no one else ever has to suffer such a thing. Studio M is a definite no-no.,…,Very beautiful room and balcony with city view.  I stayed 7 nights.  From hotel you can go to Clark quay, Bugis Juntion.  Good location.  I will stay back when i come back Singapore next month.  Highly recommended. ,Had a great 2 day 1 night stay at studio M. Needed help with Wi-Fi and Front Office Mgr Pearlyn helped me as I had some issues. She was professional and patient with my request (due to some technical glitch in my phone). Her team at memo were great and they also served great food and beverages. The reception guys were amazing in helping me to check in and loved the Halloween theme at the hotel. Not forgetting Aura your cute robot,  complimented my wonderful experience. Thank you! ,I tend to only write reviews when the hotel experience has either been exceptional or particularly deplorable - unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category - and despite our habit of taking staycations each weekend, this is the first time I've been galvanised into writing a local review.  Expectations were already tempered (low) as the hotel and its pricing falls squarely in the 'Budget' category for me.  Check-in was an arduous 20-30 minute affair - a long queue of guests had already formed when I arrived about 2.30pm. The reception staff who attended to me forgot to present a complimentary amenity kit accorded with the stay, and we had to speak with a separate front desk staff later that afternoon before they realised the oversight and rectified the error.  The very, compact room had marks and scuffs on the walls, missing bathrobes that we had to phone reception for, non-existent ventilation and grout in the shower stall (with a door that refused to close till I literally put my back into it), an unmistakable and uncomfortable dampness that permeated the entire room, and a disappointingly forgettable breakfast (only my partner bothered to get out of bed for it).  Despite all the negatives above (and there are certainly quite a number), they would not, under normal circumstances, warrant the effort to pen a review, but would just have been a quiet mental reminder to self to bring our money elsewhere.  However, a loss that occurred relegated what had initially been just a below-average experience, into firmly negative territory.  During the stay, my partner had insisted on bringing along two stuffed toys  (each about the length of my forearm) that my two-year old nephew had left behind in my car. For some inexplicable reason that will forever only make sense in his little mind, my partner felt the toys would be safer with us in the room, than in my car (which was parked on the hotel grounds). He forgot to retrieve the items from the bed when we checked out on 6th Nov, and the loss was discovered on the night of the 8th, when we met my nephew and his parents.  Frantic phone calls and emails to Studio M ensued, and I returned to the hotel the afternoon of the 9th, asking if they could conduct another thorough check. Front Desk was helpful and patient during the process, and made the Housekeeping Supervisor come to the lobby to speak with me. Cherry (the HS) was apologetic, but told me they could not find the lost items in Lost and Found. When I asked to speak with the specific person(s) who had cleaned the room, she told me it was not possible as she could not pinpoint exactly which individuals had cleaned the room as cleaning was contracted out to external parties (surely this point should be a cause for worry!!).  I explained that it had been extremely heartbreaking to see a 2-year old child crying and screaming that his favourite toys had been lost forever, and told Cherry I would offer a monetary reward to any staff member who could find, and return the toys. Alas, she reported that their subsequent checks of the room turned up nothing, and said that the Housekeeping team had denied seeing any toys in the room.  Over the years, my travel companions have on occasion, misplaced laptops, electronics, cash, expensive bottles of wines....all in varying tiers of hotels worldwide, with the items invariably finding their way back to their rightful owners - I now know not to take good fortune/hotel staff for granted.  The solo point for the review goes to the helpful and patient reception staff who were on duty on 9th November, as well as Cherry, who took the effort and followed up on the loss with me.   I blame the loss fully on the carelessness and stupidity of my partner. However, I find it disappointingly questionable and unacceptable that there is zero accountability in terms of tracing specific Housekeeping staff who cleaned the room, and that two toys of that size would go unnoticed. That, coupled with the poorly-maintained condition of the room, would make me loathe to ever return again.,…","Trendy,Mid-range",9080,Agoda.com,192,24,100

The bedrooms are filled with bunkbeds so it can accommodate enough people. Our food was thrown away, and I don't know who did it but it was not by one of us. I find it very strange. The staff was friendly. ,I love it for: 1. Location: near Lavender MRT station, Bus stops, restaurants, super market (super convenient!) 2. Friendly uncle at the reception desk 3. Fast check-in/check-out process 4. Lemongrass or frangipani-like scent when entering the building 5. Clean bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen 6. There's a washing machine, only SGD4 per use 7. I didn't have any bed bug experience, slept totally well! 8. If you're a Moslem, I saw sajadah you can use for shalat 9. Locker available outside bedroom, bring your own padlock 10. Spacious common room, so if you need space to pack your bags, you may do it there :)  You might want to consider: 1. No shampoo/soap (but if you forgot bringing your own, there's a super market nearby) 2. Breakfast: white bread with choice of mixed fruit jam or, peanute butter, coffee and tea (enough for me!) 3. No fridge 4. No bed-side lamp 5. No elevator 6. I was on 2nd floor, there were 3 bathrooms but not all with hangers. There are 2 toilet-mixed-with-bathrooms, means toilet seats are always wet ,…,When we arrived we actually surprised with how small the room that we get, compare how it's look on the pictures. Glad they have quite big common area so we can use that room for praying, eats and fo small chit chat there, at least. Also, even after they state we will get loundry service, it means you need to pay it differently, so its actually wasnt include in your rents. The bathroom was so small, and they only have 2 unit bathroom, so you need to wait a little bit longer to use it since you need to share it with people who rents in the same level with you. For wifi, I think they quite good, except the connection sometimes got cut when you use it. Something we really love for this place is because the areas was really strategis to everywhere! If you enjoy long walking like us,, you can reach many area from here too~  Ps: its better for you to stop at lavender station! ,…,I stayed at this hostel for 3 days. I must say this is a pretty average B&B and I wasn’t satisfied with the overall stay. Throughout the stay I struggled to get the AC working as it was humid in Singapore In the month of July. Several times I asked the staff member to fix the AC, he just fiddled with the remote and left after giving a confused reaction. I was given a bed in an 8 bed dormitory. The breakfast was basic which is not much of an issue. The only thing I liked about this place is it is located right next to the Lavender MRT station, hence, it was pretty convenient to go anywhere. There are departmental stores close to the place which makes buying stuff easy. Also there are many food joints, hence, buying food was never a problem. Having said that, I will not stay here, again!,…,I was hesitant before i decided to visit Singapore last month  for my birthday trip, why? Because that was my first time visited singapore, people told me singapore is an expensive country to visit, and i am just a backpacker, the i just decided spoke to myself just try.  I found this hotel through a booking hotel applucation and the price was shocked me, amazingly cheap, so cheap!  Located so close to Lavender MRT station, 20 minutes walking to Marina Bay Area, easy to find foods around, really perfect location.

Plush Pods Hostel,4.0,391 reviews,#64 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,First of all: check-in closes at 10:30pm, not 11:30pm as the Hotels.com page suggests.   I contacted the hostel before arriving and was promised a fridge in the room, though when we arrived there weren’t one.   The WiFi was patchy at best the first day and after that it was completely nonexistent, except for an hour or so a day. Tv also didn’t work so relaxing in the room after a long day in the sun was not very fun. WiFi, a bed, and a bathroom are the only things I really need when staying at a hotel/hostel so when one of them is missing I get a bit pissy! One of the two staff members I talked to was nice and tried his best at resolving the issue.  No divider for the shower, and the drain was slow, so everything from floor to waste bin to toilet paper got soaked.   The place is, technically smoke free but on each floor there’s a balcony without a door where you can smoke. I wasn’t bothered by it in the room though as they are located in another hallway.  The hotels.com page says there’s daily cleaning; the hostel states that they clean every Friday and Tuesday; we didn’t get a cleaning on Friday, Tuesday, or any other day. Trash is thrown in a bin on each floor’s balcony. By day 5 the bin was overflowing and bags of trash were put on the floor around it. By day 7, when we were leaving, the trash still hadn’t been emptied. There’s also no washer/dryer in the room, as hotels.com states, but they do offer a laundry service, and there’s a 24 hours self-service just across the street.  I do like the area with Bugis MRT just a few steps away. There’s also a lot of malls and restaurants close by. ,…,The hotel is near to mrt station and mall but it'll take you ages to find the hotel sign.  The room and bathroom are filthy where dust and rubbish can be found on the floor. The bathroom don't even have soap and shampoo. Totally not worth the stay.,Honestly it's lucky it's getting 1/5. Photos of the rooms don't reflect the actual rooms in the hotel so make sure you read other reviews first (the mistake my s*** kicker made).   The room we were initially offered was smaller than Harry Potter's cupboard under the stairs. No bed frames, just mattresses on the floor covered in what looked like Sasquatch hair and somewhat dusty. There wasn't a window in sight, and the mattresses were so close that you'd probably get done for grooming your neighboring prisoners.   The bathroom was understandably a wet-room however the hairs in the drain and smell didn't indicate any form of cleaning prior to when we were welcomed to the devil's domain.   Dodgy.   ,i might take too long to write this review as my trip to plush pod was early this year on late march for coldplay's concert. The location of this hostel is really great, very near to the mrt station and malls. However, during the first day i went to checkin at 3pm, the front desk guy ask me to pay 60sgd for deposit. I gave 2 notes of 50sgd and after he gave my room key i asked for the balance, and he insisted that i only pay him 60sgd! i told him that I'm very sure i gave 100sgd and i ask to him check cctv. He then told me to come back in 30mins as he need to check from the computers and all, but i couldn't wait because i need to go other places as well. and finally around 11pm i got a notification by email that he mistakenly count the money wrongly and asked me to get my, balance the next day. this is such a careless mistake. I would not be so angry if he say it nicely but instead he said it in a bad attitude. Im very glad that he gave my balance back at the end but i hope he wont make the same mistake in the future!  I stayed at deluxe room and space is very very small but good for short vacation. Cleanliness of the bed need to improve.,…,The dorms and rooms are badly maintained. Bunk beds and floors of the dorms are covered with dust and hairs all over. Toilets are badly maintained cleanliness is an issue. Proper housekeeping and maintenance of this place is seriously needed.  Only plus side of this place is the location. Right opposite the Bugis MRT.

Clean and comfortable rooms, helpful staff, and the location is great. You get to have acces to almost everything you need. They had small bathroom but it was clean.,it was a bad hostel.  it was overprice. The service was not good at all. The lady was rude.  The stairs was too high.  It has less restoom and the guests have to share.  it was terrible experience.  I will NOT go to this hostel again.,Started with the check in. The lady was rude to me but really nice to a Chinese national who arrived just before me. Not a good look. Mattress was paper thin and uncomfortable smelt terrible, blanket also did. This place is clearly for Chinese nationals. The bed I was in was literally touching the roof almost. Don’t take my word for it, see the photos. Thanks for giving me the worst bed in the hostel, and frankly racist customer service; here is your well deserved one star review. By the way the bunks are made so badly that if you move the person below you wakes up and visa-versa. Felt like they were about to break. The shower has hot water but there was no soap and you could shower while on the toilet so the toilet is always wet and unpleasant. The room smelt like a fart and, was extremely small. I felt like I was in a hobbit hole. Cannot put enough emphasis on that. This place sucks! $40/ night?!?!? For shame! I just wish I could go on but most people would have tuned out by now.,…,Strategic location. It’s just in the china town and everything you need is in there. MRT is just walking distance and food is everywhere. The cleanliness is well maintained and they have 4 bathrooms. They provide a locker to each bed and aircon functioned properly, so it’s super cool. Pillows and bed are soft and clean.Their receptionists are accommodating and they have everything you need. They are willing to help their guests, very considerate, and informative. Since our flight was beyond the check-out time, they allowed us to leave our bags in their storage room. Very affordable with breakfast. We arrived late for our check-in and they just leave a paper with instructions on how to access everything there and with the breakfast coupons.,It’s okay if you want to stay low on budget and don’t mind sleeping in low privacy and noisy environment. The staff was nice but the bunk it self had little to non-privacy and was dirty. There was a loud group with us at the dormitory so we didn’t sleep at all through out the stay.

Q Loft Hotel 1929 @ Chinatown,3.5,691 reviews,#159 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,I was introduced to this hotel via and article in Time Magazine proclaiming it as one of the best ""deals"" in Asia.  I was planning an 11 day trip to Singapore and it sounded terrific... all the rooms were unique, ""plasma TVs in every room"", etc.  I thought it would have some more character than your typical high-rise and so I booked it through a travel agency (paid in advance so that I could get the best deal).  That was my first lesson.. Never, *ever* pay for a hotel in advance unless you have been there before and can attest for it's quality.  We arrived to find the ""guy at the desk"" to be the most unfriendly person we had met in Singapore.. this trend continued.  On top of that we had reserved the suite on the roof - the *best room in the house*... However, at nearly 3:30pm, it was unavailable and after a 7 hour flight and transfer we were given the opportunity to wait in the lobby for another 30 minutes while housekeeping scrambled to clean the room.  When we finally did get to the room, it was not that bad... my first disappointment was that they ""plasma TV"" was in fact a 15 inch LCD computer screen mounted to the wall being used as a TV screen... not exactly what I had pictured, but I wasn't there to watch TV so I didn't fuss about it.    After the long flight I wanted badly to clean up a bit so I went to take a shower and found that the shower and the toilet were in the same small glass room.  (FYI: these rooms are not for shy people)  Again, I thought... ""Well this is different, but 'ok'""  I turned on the shower and about 45 seconds later the water went cold... and stayed that way!?  I couldn't believe it... For me this was particularly important because I am currently living in China and hot water isn't exactly easy to come by there either... but this was vacation and I was in a hotel that was supposed to be the best value in Asia... so hot water would seem to come along with that?  Apparently the Time reporter didn't actually STAY in the hotel.. just looked around at all the pretty chairs and thought it was *just fabulous*.   I reported this lack of hot water to the front desk and they said that they would have repairmen take a look at it... 2 days later they were finally honest with me and told me that the entire hotel didn't have hot water.  What!?!?  There never was a repairman...   This hotel sits right on a busy road, mostly from taxis that drive past in an almost infinite pattern of acceleration - brake (repeat).  The windows of the hotel do not actually seal against the building so having the windows closed is no different (as far as noise goes) from having them wide open.  You can be on the 3rd floor with your windows closed and hear conversations outside as if you are right beside them.  I had the pleasure of staying in 3 different rooms in this hotel and found this to be true in all of them.  At breakfast there is a very friendly lady (she is in the vast minority at this hotel) that will serve you 1 slice of bacon, 2 eggs, and baked beans.  There is also an instant coffee machine, one plate of fruit (watermelon, mango, caneloupe, and sometimes apples (if you're lucky they don't taste like they were soaked in salt water).  There is also some bread, 2 types of jam and a toaster.  This breakfast was advertised as ""western buffet breakfast"" - Not quite.   I have had the pleasure of staying in hotels all over the world and of all different price levels... but this didn't quite fit the description... However, it was ""ok"" so, again, if this had been the only problem... I wouldn't have worried about it.  One of the more humoring parts of breakfast is that they have only ONE set of salt and pepper shakers... so as you are eating the lady will bring them to you... and give you about 30 seconds to use them and then return to your table to gather them and pass them along to the next person in need.  Why they can't get  a few extra sets is a bit bizarre to me... ?  Something that really stuck out at me about this hotel is that the ""owner"" (this is what they called him - as he looked to be about 28 years old) would come to the hotel usually about 9:30am, wearing jeans and a very loose shirt (keep in mind everyone else at the hotel is wearing a uniform).  He would ""hang out"" in the lobby area either reading a newspaper, talking on his mobile phone and then around 11:30-12 he would leave... never to be seen again until the next morning.  Wow!  What a job he has!  To me this is the fundamental problem with this hotel... there is no hot water, there is no customer service, and it isn't priced very well (actually)... and the manager doesn't seem to care, because he isn't spending the time at the hotel to know what is going on.  His staff run the hotel.  Oh, and last but not least, the restaurant closed for 2 days of our stay due to Chinese New Year and the original bright idea was to have McDonald's delivered to the hotel instead... McDonalds!?  This is their substitute for the ""western buffet"" ?  Wow!  Fortunately, due to the complaining of other guests they changed it to Deli France which turned out to be terrible, but it was the thought that counted... My question was, when can a hotel just close part of their service?  The hotel was open, why wasn't the restaurant open?  I was so terribly disappointed with this hotel... Had I not paid for my stay in advance, I would have moved after the first night.  Unfortunately we had to stick it out knowing that all we could do was never return and try to warn as many people as possible about it's shortcomings.  We found Singapore to be a wonderful place that we would love to spend more time in exploring and learning about.  However, Hotel 1929 is officially the worst hotel I have ever stayed in... and after traveling all over the world for business, I have had my fair share of ""winners"".  Avoid if all possible! ,…,I stayed here on business and had a small room in the hotel with only a skylight (I think every room is different). Everything is compact in the hotel. Lack of privacy from the glass bathroom and lack of floor space means the room I was in was only good for one. Althougth compact it had everything I needed including free boradband which was great for my work.  Breakfast was a basic buffet and some people who are used to larger hotels might think the range is too small.  Air conditioning in the hotel is via 'split systems' and each room has its own unit. My room was on the top floor and the temp did not drop below 24c overnight. I would hope that this has been fixed by now.  Great location and staff who are all very friendly. ,Firstly, the hotel advertises the rooms are small, so no surprises there.  On arrival the staff are friendly and will answer any questions you have.  Although small, the rooms pack a fair amount of punch - they have everything you need!  They offer free water and coke a cola, as well as tea and coffee.  The beds are extreemly comfortable and the furnishings are wonderful.  I rate this hotel and its staff highly - I will be returning!,Stayed in this hotel on the way from UK to AUS at start of 6 week around the world trip. Fantastic designer chairs at every corner Eames, Jacobsen et al and the rooms are simple clean and stylish. In the heart of china town so if you have come here for the faceless western sterile Singapore shopping experience than stay around Orchard .... but if you have more sass than stay here love the atmosphere and enjoy the cultural vibe of chinatown from the pig snouts on sale in the food market 2 streets away to the street perfomers doing acrobatics for pocketmoney .....  the clothes stretched overhead to catch the breeze outside hi-rise flat windows ..... and all those friendly people. Food great - not 5 star or huge variety but like the hotle simple, and done well. ,I was recently in Singapore for a business trip.  I decided to extend a day and stay at Hotel 1929.  I've heard about good (and the occassional bad) reviews.  I was not at all disappointed and pleasantly surprised.  Previously, I stayed at the Swissotel, but my 1929 room was more memorable as it was cozy and unique.  Yes, the rooms are very small.  I was still a little bit surprised even if I've been forewarned and have seen countless pictures.  It was small, and one had little room to manoeuver.  The standard can only comfortably fit one person.   The bathroom, too, was small.  And it had glass walls.  Unless you're travelling with a partner, I would not recommend these to parents with children or friends (unless you're very comfortable with each other).  There is very little, room to manoeuver when taking a shower, but they do provide both an overhead and a telephone shower.  But the negatives aside, I love this place.  It was warm and cozy.  My bed was cozy, and I had a radio/cd player (that doubled as an alarm clock) on my small bedside table.  Overhead, I had a small reading light.  The TV was indeed a flat screen; it was small, but it fit the room quite well.  On a small table opposite my bed had a speaker phone, a very small refrigerator (it was so tiny it could only fit a can of coke and a bottle of water!), a heating kettle, and some coffee and tea.  The staff are very friendly and very professional--from the front desk down to the cleaning lady.  They contribute greatly to the welcoming atmosphere of the hotel.  They always greet you with a smile, something I never really felt at the Swissotel.  Hazley, the receptionist, was exceptional.  He allowed me to check in early (at about a little past 1pm, published check in was 2 or 3pm) and to check out a bit later (2pm, even if published check out is 12pm) with ease and no extra charge.  He was very accommodating and would effectively answer all of my queries.  Breakfast was OK, it was nothing exceptional.  But I was not expecting much, as this is a bit of a budget boutique.  On the buffet table was a choice of two types of bread (small croissants and sliced cream bread, which you can toast), two kinds of cereal, two kinds of yogurt (didn't find out if they were homemade), a limited selection of fruits, orange juice, milk, tea and coffee.    This kind lady (whose name I never asked) who was in charge of breakfast would courteously ask everyone how s/he preferred his/her eggs.  You can choose between fried or scrambled.  After a few minutes, you will be served your plate of eggs with a small serving of pork and beans, a strip of bacon and a small fried potato cut in half.  It's true about the salt and pepper shakers--but I didn't need to fight with anyone for it as I had my breakfast quite early on a Saturday morning.    Embers opens at 7:30am for breakfast.  They do serve breakfast quite late, and you're more likely to miss it if you have an early morning flight.  I had a small balcony which overlooked Keong Saik Road.  It was wonderful, the street was generally quiet--except during prayer time in the nearby hindu (?) temple.  Next to my hotel were these mom and pop eateries--good but cheap Chinese food.    Location was perfect, especially now when they're preparing for the New Year.  Only five minutes away is Chinatown's colorful shops/street market (Trengganu, Sago, Pagoda, Smith--the Food Street).  It's the place to be at night.  It's also a place to buy cheap souvenirs.  Most go for 3 for $10, like shirts and other trinkets.  I did manage to score clay magnets for 3 for $5.  Those Singapore flower pendants and earrings go for 3 for $10, although I did see a stall selling it for 4 for $10.  The Chinatown MRT is also only a 10 minutes away.  I checked with the map, though, and found that the Outram station is supposed to be nearer, but I could never find it.  In any case, the MRT's entrance along Pagoda street is a sight to behold.  It also has an upstairs garden, which is worthwhile to see.  I only stayed a night, but I will definitely come back! ,…",Mid-range,6124,Booking.com,676,108,100
ibis budget Singapore Emerald,4.0,121 reviews,#158 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,I don't quite remember why I picked this hotel but everything was a further walk than expected. The walk to Kallang MRT station is too long. The walk to the two ""nearby"" hawker centers is also too long. just enough space to open your suitcase. The towels also have their name on it. I guess to remind people where they are staying.  My laptop has very high security settings and I was not able to connect to the hotel wifi on it. My phone could connect though. This happens quite often for me on public wifi.  The hotel itself is no frills. You have a clean double bed, a small bathroom and bomb is also set off. There were two things that were annoying. The toilet paper must be the cheapest possible toilet paper. It's like the paper you see wrapping oranges or something. The second is, that when the room is cleaned a perfume bomb is also set off. I could barely breathe in there afterwards. I declined housekeeping after that.  There's an orange juice vending machine if you're so inclined. ,…,Cheap. Clean. Rooms on city side are very small, rooms on road side are larger. A bit away from tourist sites but it is less than 10min walk to MRT. We found it easier to use buses.   As for food and cafes the choice is authentically local. If you like frog porridge you will find it easy to eat, if you are looking for a Starbucks you will have to travel! There is a fresh orange machine outside the hotel which was pleasant.   Would I stay again? Maybe. If it was only option available. In a city with few decent budget hotels it is ok.  ,Stayed here for one night as our flight was cancelled and we needed a bed. Beds were very firm, uncomfortably so. Shower was good power but needed hot water turning on in advance so went cold quickly. On the plus side there was complimentary water, a kettle and a hairdryer, but no fridge. Small but clean room and did job for a night and was a good price at £45. We wanted to book a taxi back to the airport but were told the hotel would charge us to ring them up, so we hailed one from the main street. Would only go back if we had to.,We stayed for 3 nights, rooms and small but clean. Location is not bad, 10 minute walk to MTR, 4 stops to marina Bay area.  Location is quite, one block away from some shops and restaurants. Was good for a 3 night stay, as we spend most of our time exploring the city and only went to hotels to sleep.,The room was surprisingly clean and the toiletries were replenished at regular intervals.  The hotel is located in Geylang and it is a bit far from the main city but it is ok if you are willing to travel by bus. The hotel staff is a little bit cold on their expressions and gestures but they do help and guide whenever asked Although a bit expensive to everything but recommended option for a short stay  Thanks",Budget,4617,ZenHotels.com,56,5,74
Hotel 81 - Star,3.5,661 reviews,#152 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,POSITIVES – Good price for Singapore, like a new travel lodge, everything you could want, impressive room design.  NEGATIVES – Not much – no soap in hand basin.  SUMMARY – Overall I was very pleasantly pleased with the hotel and would recommend it for very serious consideration. Read on about location.  DETAILS I stayed for 3 nights in February 2015. The hotel is pretty new and very attractive both outside and in the lobby area.  My 7th floor room was very modern, clean and well set out. It had a King sized bed, a dressing table, an open style wardrobe, a modern electronic safe, a fridge  and a decent sized bathroom with modern fixtures.  There was enough hot water and the shower worked well.  The towels supplied – 2 large ones, but no hand towel.   Toiletries were provided, including a toothbrushes and they were topped up enough.  Oddly there was no soap in the hand basin which is located in the main bedroom.  This should be addressed. There was a modern medium sized  flat screen TV with which you could receive a some English speaking channels – very good.   Breakfast was not included.   The room was cleaned every day.  I found the staff to be pleasant, friendly and helpful.  The hotel located in the red light area of Singapore, a 10 minute walk from the cheap and very efficient metro train system. Be aware that the street has a fair number of massage parlors come brothels along the street.  It does not look seedy. This did not bother me but at night a number of ‘ladies of the night’ hang around at the top of the street (with there male pimps) near Geylang Road.  Perhaps not good for a family group but it did not both me much.  I slept well.  The free wifi worked well on all of my devices.  There was instant tea/coffee in the room and with free water supplied every day.  All in all I would give them 9 out of 10 and recommend the hotel for serious consideration. I would stay there again base on price and quality provision.   PS – I think Singapore is an amazing City and can’t wait to return.,…,For no frills travellers.Cheap and clean hotel with comfortable rooms. Placed in the red light quarter 3 min walking to MRT station. 24/24 hours supermarket just outside the hotel. I'm a solo traveller girl and I use to stay there when I'm in town. Despite the reputation of the area, I consider it supersafe.,Hotel is located in the middle between airport and city hall but with Singapore metro connection is not a problem at all. It seems brand new, rooms are clean with very good standard. Having in mind prices in Sinagpore (for private room) this solution is really good option. Places to eat - just nearby:),Hotel 81 is a budget chain, and make no mistake you get a budget product, but that does not make for a bad experience.   Hotel 81 Star is located on Lorong 18 in Geylang in the heart of the red light district. It's still a very safe area though. This is still Singapore, and I experienced nothing beyond a few enquiries as to my immediate plans for the evening. The hotel has the advantage of being close to some of the best eating places in Geylang. Any of the hawker centres along Geylang road are well worth a visit.  The reception was friendly and efficient, although it is a pay upfront arrangement, which is unusual, but given the location and the likely clientelle not suprising.  The deluxe room was larger than expected, clean and tidy. The bed was large and comfortable. There, was complimetary bottled water, coffee and instant noodles provided. The room was made up each day for our return.  The bathroom whilst small was functional and clean, with very, very hot water if required.  The only slight downside was noise in the early morning in the corridor outside the room.  All in all very good value, and a different view of Singapore. ,…,We were after a cheap and clean option for a one night stoppover and Hotel 81 (Premier) Star proved to be just that. For approximately AUD$68 (Agoda) we stayed in a superior double room which although small, contained all the necessities (comfortable bed, tv, small refrigerator, clean bathroom, free wi-fi, room safe & hairdryer). Breakfast was not included but there are plenty of food options nearby. We ate twice at the Food Loft food court (Cnr Aljunied Rd & Sims Ave) which was a 5 minute walk away. Caught the bus to Little India for lunch (less than SGD$1)and returned via the MRT to Aljunied Station (about an 8 minute walk to the hotel). Off peak taxi fares to and from airport cost around SGD$15-SGD$16. Probably wouldn't want to stay here long term but more than happy with, Hotel 81 (Premier) Star as a transit hotel.,…",Modern,,,66,7,77
Hotel NuVe,3.5,347 reviews,#4 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil","Share, ,A no frills hotel located amongst excellent food establishments and bars.  All within a 5 min walking distance.  What more can you ask.  Although the rooms are small, but you're not gonna spend the whole day in the room.  Its a launchpad to explore all that Bugis has to offer.  Check-in was smooth and when i requested for a change in bed linen as there was a stain, room service came in very promptly and changed the linen.  Worth a 2nd visit.,Nice, simple yet cozy room set up. Check in was quick and the staff are friendly and accommodating.  Giving a very homely feel. We booked the classic room which is slightly more spacious than their basic room. There is no drinking plastic bottles given, but instead they give a glass bottle in each room. You can fill up your water from the water dispenser which comes in both still and sparkling. Love the eco-friendly concept though a little hassle.  Overall, enjoyable stay.,The front desk staff, Careleen was so helpful and helped us with our last minute reservation request with a huge smile on her face. It’s really nice to have a genuinely friendly staff at the front desk to greet and assist the visitors. We definitely had a wonderful stay in Hotel Nuve. Will definitely recommend to everyone 😊,3days2nights.  Good: Air con is strong. They have balcony and the whole stretch is urs to enjoy although the view is not fantastic. Free minibar.

Some areas smell like pee. First day, toilet is not clean. theres coffee patch. overall, the room is okay but dirty.,pros: - friendly staff - has a bidet in the toilet - has lifts - complimentary mini bar  cons: - dirty rooms (the carpet was visibly dirty and there were dust clumps underneath the built in mini table) - 1 ply toilet paper (it crumbles so no use using it to dry yourself) - room slippers have to be requested - flat pillows",,,,480,83,100

Hotel Clover 5 HongKong Street,3.5,411 reviews,#149 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,For a great location and more than adequate accommodations, this hotel will not disappoint.  The room was clean and tidy and I found the bathroom and shower to be very nice.  But the best part of this hotel is a manager named Aileen. She was warm, helpful, funny: the type of person that everyone wants to be around. Her recommendations were spot on.  I’m definitely going back and hope to run into her again. She was a joy.,What type of company refuses to give a refund when you cant fly to the country due to a Pandemic. They say we have a no refund policy. THis is very bad customer service theis company needs to realize what they did. I would highly not recommend them due to the reaction of the ownership and so called policy even if  during a no fly order they still dont refund. Wake up Clover Group and refund me,We were due to stay at hotel Clover from tomorrow for 4 nights on our return trip from NZ. Obviously due to the Coronavirus we are unable to go. The hotel booking was non-refundable but they immedietly refunded the money, when we cancelled the room, even without us asking. We are very grateful as the flights home were quite an outlay!  We will hopefully book again at some point in the future due to their generousity.  Thank you Hotel Clover in a very difficult time for all tourist venues.,Like so many other people we have had to cancel our bookings through no fault of our own, we gave this hotel 2 weeks notice that because of the GOVERNMENT restrictions we could not get there. They said 'NO' ( their caps )    So Many other hotels have done the opposit, even the one in Spain that we had an 8 night booking with said that they would only charge us for what we used, which was 1 night only.  We will not use this hotel again.,Not good value for money.  A bed which is pretty much just a matteress on the floor. Root top oasis swimming pool is not quite as pictured and wouldn't want to get in even if someone would have paided me.

Downstairs it's quite lively at night (if you're into that) and on the weekend they roads are closed off for the bars and people to spill out onto the street. Having said that, the rooms were quiet and we weren't disturbed by the bars downstairs. We chose the Double room as a couple and it was enough space for the both of us - it wasn't too big but just enough as we were out most of the day anyways.

Citadines Fusionopolis Singapore,4.0,48 reviews,#201 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,The location is very convenient, there is internal access to MTR One North and its foodcourt. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Although the room was spacious, it was a little tired looking. It had a '70 inspired decor which was 'kind of cool' but there were some permanent stains on the floor. The gym is under cover, but open to the city. It is nice to be on the machines while watching the thunder and lightning over the city.,I stayed at citadines for just over a week in September due to work commitments in the area. It was a great location for my work and had supermarkets and lots of places to eat close by so that was handy. The apartment itself had great views of the city and was set over two floors. Could be a great hotel, but lacked finishing touches. We had a floor tile missing from the floor, the bath files leaked and ants managed to find there way from anywhere.  If you are looking for around this location it is a great spot but I don't think I would look to stay here again. ,This is in the heart of fusionopolis. Symbiosis and Galaxis  is 1 minute walking. One North tube station is 2 level down in the same building.  Surrounded by atleast 20 food joints and 2 major food courts. It gives very clean duplex serviced apartments. Fairly decent breakfast. Very good staff. Don't forget to collect your green Apple from the lobby in the evening. Terrific view of Singapore port from each room. Never stayed in ny hotel with auch a great view.Worth a stay even with family.,We stayed there for more than a week. The premium loft is beautiful and cozy. It was truly a wonderful place to stay. They do not have their own gym but you get to use the facilities such as the swimming pool of Fitness First next door. Children aren't allowed in though.   The staff at Citadines is always cheerful and ready to greet. I was ill one day and when the cleaning staff found out, she offered to make me some hot drinks to make me feel better. I was touched.   Location is fantastic too. Though it isn't in town, the One North MRT station is just below which makes it easily accessible to anywhere you want to go. There are many eateries and a supermarket too so it is very convenient.,My son stayed at Citadines Fusionopolis for 15 days recently.  The whole stay was a very good and the unit is a conducive place to live, cook, chill and basically live life for 2 weeks.  The front desk staff was exemplary with special mention to Ms Nur (Manager, Front Desk), and with special thanks to Nadirah, Darren and Youges. They were very pleasant and always helpful!  The view was to-die-for and it was good to be able to open the balcony door for fresh air. Aircon was great, the bed was super comfortable. The desk was big and with multiple sockets available, with ample space for his laptop and WACOM tablet. Internet/ WIFI was strong and stable.  Although clean, the carpet upstairs in the loft bedroom looked worned, and needs to be updated, but that was the only draw back. , The kitchen had a family-size fridge, a good quality hob and hood, and the washer was like brand new. There was no dryer but there was hanging rack to dry clothes in the windy balcony. There is a microwave oven, but no conventional oven to roast meats.  There was generally enough pots, pans, utensils and cutlery to cook a simple meal, but I would suggest getting a non-stick frying pan, non-stick spatula, chopping board and some microwaveable boxes if you intend to stay for more than a few days.   Overall my son had a wonderful experience there. Overall, A++ and certainly recommended!  As a side-note: Citadines Fusionopolis, although not in the tourist belt, is well-placed with the One North MRT station just in the attached mall in Basement 2, so getting to just about anywhere is convenient. Plus there is a huge well-stocked Cold Storage Supermarket in the basement too, with several eateries in the mall.,…","Mid-range,Business",,,59,3,77
Jayleen Clarke Quay Hotel,3.5,80 reviews,#204 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Filipino","Share, ,For two and 1/2 months,  this hotel proved to be a safe, cozy, place to reside during COVID19.  The front Desk including Sarah and Michelle were terrific.  They helped me find everything I needed in terms of supplies and inspired me to see some very special Singapore places when the city started to open up. The refrigerator in the room was great, the cleanliness, the clothes line, the warmth of all the staff all added up to a great stay!  I loved Singapore and all it has to offer.  This wonderful iittle hotel made it possible for me to stay for as long as I did and explore Singapore's beauty.,As others have said, the rooms are very small, but for people who travel with carry-on bags, this hotel has some nice advantages. Most importantly, it was quite clean and very quiet all day and night. The walls in our room were solid concrete.  The staff was mature and happy to answer questions. The breakfast was across the street and offered some good hot options such as a noodle dish, tomatoes, eggs, and fried rice.  One final good part was that the room had several convenient outlets to charge phones and other electronics.  In summary, it's a budget hotel that does many things right and only a block from the river walk and across the street from Clarke Quay subway station.,Husband and I stayed here for a 5 day stay before  we boarded our cruise ship .   Hotel is central location of Clarke quay .  nice staff that work there and next to a 7evelen and right opposite Clarke quay MRT.   Hotel was pretty basic but had all we needed  We got a standard queen room, it is very small . Bathroom was small but water was hot.   Tv worked well only had a couple of Channels but had hbo movie Channel which we liked.   The pros:  Central location  Tidy rooms  Nice staffs  Room clean   Cons:  Small rooms Hard mattress   ,Handy to Clarke Quay metro and buses, and fairly cheap for Singapore so if those are the only things that matter, go ahead and stay here.  But be warned, to say the room is small is an understatement.  Having no external windows only makes it worse.  I felt like I was trapped in a broom closet.  The ‘bathroom’ (hardly qualifies as a room) is so small if you’re sitting on the toilet you will get a shower at the same time - the toilet paper and towels have to be kept outside or they will get wet, and the sink is next to the bed because it doesn’t fit in the bathroom.  The room is also not clean - there was a long hair (not mine) on the bath towel, someone’s false nail on the floor, and a disgusting unidentifiable stain on the shelf.   Breakfast is included but again, the only, thing going for it is that it’s free.,…,Pros: -Across from MRT. -Next to Clark Quay...good night life/restaurants. -Walking distance to everywhere. -Mr.Lee on reception was very nice and helpful.

The toilet and shower were very moldy. The place it self smelt quite bad and the location was far from centre. However the bed itself was clean with no bugs in sight and it was a good pricing for Singapore.,The only positive about this hostel is that staff are friendly and helpful. The hostel itself needs to be completely renovated. The 4 person room in which I stayed was completely covered in mold, you could smell it strongly as soon as you walked in the room and throughout downstairs, now as a result am ill with a throaty cough. On the ground floor there are 2 toilets/showers to accommodate 16+ people and on the 1st floor only 1 toliet to accommodate 25+ people! Absoulte joke. I know Singapore is expensive but you can find somewhere alot better than The gap year(reddoorz@ lavender street) for a similar price.,Short stay with my family... 2nights but super worth it.  I booked.for 1 room with 2 bunk bed just enough for 4 people..  The room is comfty and we slept so good..  The room is clean..the hotel receptionist is very accomodating.. The bathroom and shower is great with good water pressure. Also theres a free breakfast provided  basically bread and spreads.. Really worth our stay even its just along themain road you wont hear the noise inside.  Its really comfortable stay.. Will.definetely comeback maybe oneday,Friendly staffs... yummy breakfast unlimited use of aircon  Though bathrooms are limited but its not a big deal especially if you will spent most of your time touring singapore and you just stop by the hostel to sleep and take a shower   Near mrt station and minimart plus bus stop,- ONE TOILET for 2O beds. - ONE SHOWER for 2O beds. - 12 Blocks from METRO.

Coziee Lodge,3.5,194 reviews,#96 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese","Share, ,We arrived around 10 pm in the evening, tired after our flight and a long day. We booked this accommodation many months in advance using hotels.com and even paid the room months in advance. But when we were to checkin for our room, the receptionist said there was no booking from us and no more bed would be available as well. First I thought he was joking or misunderstood me, but he was serious about it. I couldn't believe that was true, as I had my printout of the booking confirmation with me and I even got another confirmation email of my booking just days before our arrival. But still we were standing there at 10 pm without a room. It's so hard to believe what they said about not receiving a confirmation of my booking. I'm a frequent traveller for a long time already and, something like that never happened so far. I only heard about experiences from others, that some hostels will give an already booked room to a walkin guest or to somebody who wants to stay longer.  It seems something similar happened to me. Don't go there, if you don't want to risk to be stranded in Singapore with your luggage during night time... After two or three hours we finally found another hotel with available rooms nearby, where we could go to find some sleep before we continued our travel to Bali the next day.,…,My boyfriend and I stayed in their double bedroom for 3 nights booked via Agoda. Location was around a 3-minute walk to Kallang MRT station. It is also 8 stops away from the airport via MRT. They were able to accomodate our late checkin request (2am) easily. The staff were very friendly as well. The double bedroom had an ensuite shower room with heater, but no toilet. We had to use a shared one down the hall. But the shared toilet was clean so it was no biggie. They also provided free towels, socket adaptors and a blowdryer in the room. Wifi was fine too. The only thing that bothered me a little was that I could hear people in the next room, maybe it was because of the wooden walls. Overall, I would surely stay at this hotel again!,We stayed in Coziee lodge for 2 nights. After reading the reviews, we chose to stay here as we were led to believe there would be a shower in the private room. It was actually broken, so we couldn't use it -  it was taped up and left really dirty. The TV also didn't work, we didn't mention it because the staff didn't understand most of the questions we asked previously.   We arrived quite late after a long journey and the guy at check in was unfortunately unfriendly and spoke little English. We were surprised to discover that you could not pay for the room on card. Considering the high prices for this place, that was disappointing. We waited around for ages whilst the guy had a chat to some other people that came in after us before he showed us to the room.   You have to leave, your shoes at the door (fair enough) but I was given huge replacements and told to wear them. I nearly fell over a few times before giving in and just going barefoot!  We were given no explanation of breakfast, although the kitchen is tiny anyway, so we didn't bother trying to figure it out.   The bathroom situation is quite dire, there's 4 toilets, in two areas of the hostel and only 2 decent showers. If you stay in a private you are located on a different floor to the bathrooms, so it's a faff particularly in the night. Be prepared to queue for both particularly in the morning if you are staying here!   Location is good, close to the MRT. The room is decent too, with good aircon. But unless you speak Chinese, don't expect any level of customer service. We found all staff were quite unhelpful.   Overall we were totally underwhelmed. The service and facilities do not match the price and we would not stay again! ,…,I reserved a bed from 2 nights in Coziee Lodge. Since my ETA is at 3am, I emailed the hostel (even after getting assurance from booking.com that my request for late check-in was approved), I had to make sure. I got an email that somebody will be at the reception at 3am to welcome me.  I arrived in front of the hostel via airport shuttle. I rang the doorbell for 15-20 mins. Nobody was answering. I was getting frustrated since I had a late night flight, with all my luggages, very tired and hungry but to no avail. What's more frustrating was this hostel is locate din Geylang, Singapore's red light district. Whilst I was ringing the doorbell, constant passing of prostitutes with their customers made me more irritated. (I'm a female solo traveller which was why it's uncomfortable)  I, ended up hailing a cab, showed my phone with a map to take me to another hotel (I never checked the price firsthand, I just wanted to rest and sleep for my early morning purpose in Singapore but I ended up checking in a hotel 5x the price of what I was supposed to pay in Coziee Lodge)  After that, I received an email from booking.com for my ""no show"". The guts of this hostel... I ranted via email and even dared the hostel to check their CCTV footages that I was in fact there, ringing their goddamn doorbell. I even sent my airport shuttle receipt/coupon.  Then I got a reply that somebody was in the reception waiting for me but the doorbell was busted so they didn't hear. VERY EFFICIENT, right?!,…,Room is clean and quiet however, I don't like smell of the sheets.  It smells like it came from a treasure box that has not been open for centuries!  There's also a private shower in the room which is broken and can't be use. They have free breakfast (FYI it's only bread, butter or jam, and coffee) which is good for a budget driven traveler.  However, since kitchen area is very dirty, utensils also looks so dirty, and it's just 2 meters away from the toilet and shower room, we just let go of the free food and went out to look for a cheap hawker place.  I've only seen their bed bank outside their doors and it seems so dark (even with lights on) and very small space in between to walk on.  Location - it is very accessible.  Walking distance from the Singapore Sports Hub (if you're, planning to watch a concert and in a very tight budget you can stay here).  It is also 2 blocks away from the train station (Kallang station).,…",Budget,,,144,23,69
XY Hotel Bugis Singapore,3.5,178 reviews,#197 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, French, Chinese, German","Share, ,I decided to stay at XY because of the high rating and cool looking different themed rooms. Got the Junior Suite at a relatively good deal last minute same day.  XY whatsapp-ed me (1434hrs) to inform me that the checked-in time was 1500hrs onwards and I acknowledged. My friend assisted with the check-in at 1830hrs and was told that we were upgraded 2 tiers above the junior suite  (PROJECTOR ROOM) as the JUNIOR SUITE WAS LEAKING.   As an avid traveller/staycay enthusiast initially we felt delighted by the service HOWEVER, we were shocked that the room 2 tier above the initial room (claimed by the BOSS MRS HAN) was in a terribly BAD state. Here is why (In-room TV was not working, bare BASIC decos worst than deluxe/other suite room, DIRTY as if the room was left untouched for, weeks, the projector and laptop were placed in an awkward position near the entrance door with NO SOUND output.   We requested to change to another room but FO said the hotel was in full occupancy ... and the only solution they could offer would be to REFUND the room. I checked again Agoda and XY official website, they do have the deluxe room avail and we are cool if you could offer that too ... BUT NO. It didn't happen.  Why I am writing this long review and giving XY HOTEL a bad rating due to the fact that they could tell us the JUNIOR SUITE was leaking and told us the intended room they offering prior to arrival so that we could decide to proceed or not. Customer service by the front office agents (probably interns) and hotel boss (MRS HAN) need further improvement and understand your guest concern.   To the Hotel Boss, please allow your guest to finish speaking with you and reply to them back afterwards. Do not cut the conversation and act as if you were showing that care and assurance that our stay would be great . And, as paying hotel guests, we have the rights to choose to book a stay through AGODA or through DIRECT.   Dear Readers, if you have the plan to book your next stay with XY, please check the room photos taken by fellow guests and do not be deceived by the edited/ published pictures.  Just our luck that such bad treatment was received.  CHAO XY!,…,I was looking forward to give it a try for a very long time. Since I always go for a good looking places with a good reviews so I decided to try it out.  I wanted to go for a cloud suit or etc since I like big bathtubs and glass walls. I finally got a chance while ago.  The location is perfect near the haji lane and etc. I would't say that it was an easy to fine but so far so good.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Its a very small boutique hotel and you can see them dinning on the first floor all the time so it feels hommy and looks the same.  The first thing I usually paying attentions is amenities and cleanliness. Thats why my review is going to be very very LOW. I can see my feet trail on the floor , duo to the snow you might thinks - NO NO< its a mountain of dust all around, the room. And this is only the room :cloud suit as they have! Cos all the pricy rooms are suits - so you need to pay extra.  The bathtub is big and etc. But the hot water is a different story . If you wanna make a full hot tub than it will take forever since hot water stops every 10 min. I do understand a heater and etc - but yeah, cant even enjoy that.  TV is working but no cable or etc - and the fun part of the TV, its located the way that you cant even see it from the bed. if you like to watch properly and etc - forget about that.  The pool has a glass window so you can see people are eating downstairs. Its kinda cool with some floating swans . But I just wonder when the last time someone was checking the pool area - the tables are so dirty, sticky, spilt wine and etc. Especially when you can see the family or staff just downstairs through the glass window - i was pretty closed to ask someone to stop eating and come over to clean but i dont like to make noise and etc.  Food. Well, the staff was saying that its nice and tasty but unfortunately, after seeing all the dirty and dusty amenities I do have a doubt about the kitchen as well.  The lift is cute and fun to use, you have to press and hold the button if you want the lift to keep running.  As you can see some of the flours and bubbles on my pictures - nope, its not a package, i just prepared some a small surprise for my gf but you can see some cleanliness issues on my photos.  So I did enjoy my stay for awhile but Im allergic to dust so I was sneezing and etc during the night.  I would recommend this place for staycation if they could fix the clean the place up.  Cos the place is quite strategically promising.....,…,The mere 15-room XY Hotel Bugis (owned by Kua Hwee Cheng and husband Han Bin) which occupies three adjoining shophouse lots along the northern extremity of Jalan Klapa within Kampong Glam epitomizes conspicuously tiny no doubt, however it more than made up for in charm as well as conviviality. From lobby to hallways to onsite restaurant, assorted art paraphernalia pepper existing common spaces; even the rooms themselves strut enigmatic murals that would surely incite an emotional reverie at first sight. Madame boss herself was outwardly decorous, indefatigably meticulous - often either asking after guests or imbuing the uninitiated with touristy pointers.   The highest tier family suite reserved during this staycation turned out to be some skylighted attic nook spanning just 35, square meters. Yet, rather than feeling stifled we were suitably enthralled, what with utilitarian furniture and kooky kitsch of yesteryear seen thrust upon a splashy orange-black mise en scène. Overall cleanliness didn't quite pass muster though, bummer (read: clammy floorboards, dust-speckled clothing rack, stained bathtub among others).  Regardless we managed a solid night's sleep, skipping breakfast altogether next morning (actually they don't even serve any, wth) in favour of simply lazing by the poolside. Then it was time to bid adieu.  (Info: we stayed there in December 2020)  ,…,Currently staying in Room 209. Didn’t come here with sky high expectations, as I understand this is a boutique hotel. But I expected a fun and simple cozy stay experience. When I entered, no one was at the front desk. But a lady, whom I believe might be the manager or boss of the property as she was attending a meeting, came to us. Within a minute, a front desk staff came back and attended to us. Friendly cheerful staff. Great start to our staycation. It was also great that they sent me a text to tell me what time my room will be ready so that I won’t rush over and have to wait around. That allowed me to plan what time to go to the hotel.   My room was on the second floor. Stayed in the Junior Suite (Map Room?). The door to my room was difficult to open. A staff had to help me., Quirky and pretty designs on the wall, but there are many visible stains and even tape marks. Only 1 small bottle of each bath gel and shampoo were provided when there are 2 persons staying. This would be easy to resolve if there’s a phone in the room, but there’s none. On the website it says a Manet phone is given upon check in, but we weren’t given any Nor were we informed how we can contact the front desk. I went to the website, looked for the number and called the front desk line with my phone to get more shower amenities. Minibar was complimentary, which included soft drinks. Bottled water, coffee, tea, kettle and slippers are also provided. TV quality okay, but only 5 channels. You can also see the wires dangling behind, they didn’t bother to even tuck the wires neatly with some kind of cord cover or cable tube.   Anyway, I went out and when I returned later I found that the door to my room could be opened without the key card. A basic safety measure which any hotel, regardless of how many stars, should have! I texted the front desk via WhatsApp, and they mentioned, and I quote, “...I will send our house keeping guy up to your room now...”. That was at 9.46pm. At 10.34pm, i texted them again to say no one has come up. I understand some hotels might be understaffed, and may need more time to attend to guests, but at least give me an update or follow up after 45 mins? That’s when I knew for sure I was upset with the hotel. A basic safety feature not met. Of course they wouldn’t overlook it on purpose. Fine. But taking 45 mins without any follow up on an important safety issue? Really? Is that hospitality at XY Hotel Bugis?  The Housekeeping staff came within 5 mins and he apologised, explaining that he was the only staff on shift and was on break. He was polite and helpful and resolved the issue within 10 minutes. He also explained that the card reader batteries had run out of power. I was only highly disappointed when they didn’t take initiative to update me after 45 mins. Clearly, safety measures are not important to them.   ,…,Visited Bistro XY this week, which is a small restaurant situated in the lobby area of XY Hotel, for lunch with a friend.  It was my first visit to this interesting corner of Bugis, which is one or two bus stop distance away (depending on where you board the bus) from Bugis MRT Station on Victoria Street.  XY Hotel is a unassuming townhouse building in a quaint conservation area in between the main streets of North Bridge Road and Victoria Street.  We had a table nearer to the kitchen area, which was also directly under the glass bottom of the swimming pool above us. It took a while for me to get used to seeing waves (and reflections) on the table mat and the food.  I had tapas for appetisers (mussels and mushrooms in olive oil), prawn aglio olio in yellow noodles as the main.  , The tapas were light and did helped to “raise” my appetite. The prawns in the pasta were a bit tough to de-shell but otherwise quite refreshing as it was the first time I’d tasted it on yellow noodles.  Dessert was durian cakes - soft and fluffy. I had to resist the temptation to ask for more.  The Bistro opened just two months ago. Staff are friendly although you could tell that they could be quite new to the job.  I took the opportunity (with the manager’s permission) to visit some of the guest rooms. Each of the room has its own painted design and quirkiness. Being a 3 storey building in a mid terraced row, there are not much views from the guest rooms.   If you would like to experience living in a historic part of Singapore with a strong ethnic flavour and the convenience of a MRT Station, this is a good place to explore.,…",,,,424,68,100

The reception, if you can call it that is like dirty and not like a hotel reception. The rooms are even worst. Omg, don’t be fooled by the picture. We were almost in tears when we arrived there after flying for 17 hrs. And saw those rooms. Please don’t stay there. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. That cannot make up for the dirty, rundown so called hotel. It’s also way over prices. It’s not even worth terrible. It’s  minus terrible. I want back my money. Pamela.,I stayed 2 nights. It great location and Boat Quay, Merlion fountain, Museum, Financial hub, harbour near Durian place over looking Marina bay were all in walking distance however the hotel was pretty stinky mainly in lift and corridor. Being on top floor, room was average and great view from rooftop. I couldn't find any other hotel in this convenient location during Christmas time and paid the double price..,Omg this hotel is really dirty, old and overpriced. Has really bad smell. We cant sleep cuz of bad some strong smell. Also some insect bit me during the night. I never recommend this place. If u book it, you will regret👎,Staff are nice but the hotel is very smelly and dirty. We always have to hold our breath. The room is super small, old and smelly too. We asked for 2 towels since we didn’t request for room clean, they gave it to us dirty and a lot of hair. Both towels have plenty of hair. Eeiiiwww. For sure not recommending it. ,This is our second time to stay here, this time with elderly mobility impaired parents. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were on same floor and with rooms to suit mobility impairment. Breakfast was more than adequate.

Bright Star Hotel,3.5,97 reviews,#8 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,We did only stayed in this hotel over night. Staff at the reception in the night was not so helpful. But the lady at the reception the other day was very helpful though we could not get the late check out. The hotel is not bad for a short stay.,Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights.  Receptionist was okay, not overly friendly.  No lounging area for sitting.  Therefore first impressions is, you think that you are walking into a shop.  Rooms are basic, but spacious. Bed linen fresh and clean. Hairdryer never worked, luckily booked two family rooms,  used hairdryer in other room. No shelf to place shower gel in bathroom.  Had to put on floor in shower. No safe in bedroom.   Room a little tired and dated,  needs modernising.   Overall, if I were to visit Singapore again, I would not stay at Bright Star Hotel, I would prefer to spend a little more money and stay in the Singapore part of town, where it's less crowded and cleaner. Also,  where there is a gym and other amenities.   Plus is there are many taxis available at a, reasonable price (Minimum/Base Price SGD 3.70), also MRT nearby.  Transportation links very good.   If you are looking for somewhere to just lay your head a night time, this is the hotel for you. If you want a little more amenities and other facilities, book elsewhere.,…, Cheap price for Singapore. Can walk to Aljunied Mrt (600m) and bus stops (400m). From Changi Mrt to Aljunied Mrt $1.64, change at Tanah Merah station. You can use your MasterCard or visa to tap on and off mrts and buses in Singapore. Download the SimplyGo app, add your cards and it can notify you how much your trips costs. Just make sure your bank doesn’t charge you any foreign transaction fees.  Check in was efficient and friendly. $10sgd deposit, refunded on check out. Free wifi, works great. Room has bath towels, 2 in 1 hair and body shampoo bottles, Toothbrush and toothpaste, shower cap, hairdryer. Shower only.  Supplies are replenished when you ask for housekeeping through reception. Housekeeping is by request.  Mini fridge, sealed cups of drinking water, coffee, kettle, and cups. Don’t forget to flick the switch outside the bathroom to activate hot water.  Cupboard, desk, bedside table, chairs, tv. Blackout curtains. Aircon works well. Our room on the 4th floor was fairly quiet. Sims vista market & food centre is walking distance (700m). Lots of food around. Also lots of food around Aljunied mrt.,…,Easy to locate place on Google Maps. Not sure about parking options as we did not require it. 4-5min walk from bus stops on either side. Around 10min walk from Aljunied MRT. Lots of food joints nearby along with departmental stores.  Check in was super smooth. They require SGD10 (refundable at check-out) deposit during check-in. Unfortunately we did not have any cash during check-in. However they allowed us to check-in and collected the deposit later during evening. It was a nice and warm experience.  Rooms were of standard size, albeit a little big compared to Singapore size for the price paid. Since we were staying in Singapore for 7 days, we were looking for a room with window so that natural sunlight could come in. This was the only one in our budget. Bed was big and very, comfortable.  Room also had a moderately sized wall mounted TV with working channel subscriptions, dressing table setup, two chairs with a round table, bed side reading lights, a mini fridge, tea-coffee maker set and a wardrobe.  Washroom had 24x7 running hot and cold water. Toiletries and basic morning kits were also provided.  Room service was available upon call or you need to inform the reception in the morning. Hotel staffs were polite and professional. They also agreed to let us keep our luggage at the store room as our return flight was at night.  They also provide daily water (2 small sealed cups of around 250ml each) and ready to make coffee per person.  Overall it was a great experience for our 7 days of stay at Bright Star Hotel. Absolutely safe place, lots of options to have food in the surrounding at a very reasonably price. Highly recommended.,…,My parent came over to Singapore for my graduation. My brother and I were accompanying my parent to check in to this hotel. However, The female receptionist stopped us from visiting my parent during day time with her rude tone. I have told her that I’m local , I’m not staying over and my brother will be flying off soon but she still insisting that we are going to stay over. We wanted to show her my brother’s air ticket but she refuses it. She wants us to book 4 bedded room for just visiting my parent. Isn’t it ridiculous? Thereafter, I told her that If we knew that this hotel restrict visitors at the first place , we will not book this hotel. It did not shown up when we book through agoda . So my dad told her that he never been to any hotel that will restrict visitor. Then ,, this receptionist take it so personally. She humiliated my dad and Shout at him that he is jing di Zhi wa (井底之蛙) and she repeated few times. I told her that might as well she refund my stay here then we will book another hotel.

Central 65 Hostel,3.5,263 reviews,#93 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,I have stayed at the hostel with my friends and expect nothing since the price is too cheap but we were not ready to experience the dirty bathroom and the staff were not friendly at all. Worse part (NO WIFI connection in the room) seriously? Luckily, we did not stay much in the hostel as most of the time we were out for day trip. This would be the first and last time we’ll be staying in this hostel. I hope the owner will do a renovation especially the bathroom. (It stinkssssss),Since begining staff not friendly, she more tricky. Must be careful.  Really be careful with the guy as cleaning service, he can open your room with their key even you in there. Its so bad. Without permission.  For a woman who cleaning too its so kind. She understand us.  .  We are booked 3 night for dorm room with 6 bed for only 3 person. Its mean we don't want sharing with others so thats why we booked that room not only bed. but first we check in, she said our room not available so she offer us to share with other female guest in one room.  OMG room so so so small. So glad if you can move your luggage.  I think this hostel looks like boarding house, due in our room they have complete kitchen staff its belongs to person beside my bed. Maybe its because cheap price.  But you, must carefull. I pay one room one night for 82SGD, but the first she refund me only 10SGD.  What are you kidding me.  So I argue then she refund me a half. Make me bad mood. Oke then we move to second floor our first night room sharing. I got upper bunk. Its so dangerous bed. Not strong.  Then the next day we must change room as my booking and get 4th floor.  No lift. Its not for bring heavy luggage. And got mix floor. But its okay not problem we only want our room. Oke we shock when we seen bed not change, not ironing.  For bathroom sharing in second floor only for female its better. But in 4th floor mix, smell not good. When we breakfast we meet other guest, they complain if shoes from one of them is missing. Brand adidas.  OMG have thief in here. . This hostel cheaper than others, Good location near MRT, bus stop in front of hostel. Breakfast is good. Its important if you can refil water as so much.,…,We stayed for three days four-night (8 to 10 August 2019) and I had good and bad experiences in this hostel.   Good  - This hostel is located nearby the MRT Station (Jalan Besar -  Downtown MRT) and bus station in front of it.  - You can go to Bugis or Mustafa less than 10 minutes by walking  - They provide wi-fi and quite fast.  - They provide re-fill water on the receptionist   Bad  - Staff aren't friendly  - Someone stole my brother's shoes (Adidas Ultraboost GOT series) in their locker room and I was mad because their staff couldn't show us the CCTV and they're really slow respond, the reason was only his boss can open the CCTV. We put our shoes in the locker room because they don't allow us to bring our shoes/sandals into the hostel room. So, they paid to me S$100 because, the current price of the shoes is S$200-. :(  - The toilet really messy,…,It stayed in one bed in 16 bedrooms. The bed is not that small and there is extra locker for each person with a key. It was not noisy so it’s good to have a rest and i felt pretty safe in the hostel. Moreover, it’s close to MRT station and near the hawker centre to eat. The bad things are the bed is not really clean and toilet is too small and messy.,We have informed that we’ll be arriving in the dead of the night or around dawn and when we got there, there was no one. The one who is in charge is not around, no one was there to assist us, thankfully there was this one guy who was using the computer, who is also a guest. He helped us find our room—he stopped whatever he was doing and tried to get us comfortable while he tried to find a key that has our name on and to think he was also a guest. It turns out, our roommate had the key—there was no spare for new guests!? We had to wait for him just to get to our room because he went somewhere. The room was pretty untidy. The sheets seem well kept but it looks like it hadn’t been washed since it was last used. Our friend took the upper bed space and the ceiling was dripping water,, we’re not sure why or somehow i forgot why. The bathroom is so messy and a little dirty. Shampoo sachets are on the floor, some soaps are on the floor too. The drain kinda clogged so when you shower the water builds up and you have to take it slow. Breakfast! Finally! Bread, butter and milk were provided. It’s self service so yeah. Go grab a plate, get some of those bread, if you want some butter or toast it, go do it, grab a glass, pour out some milk, look for a table and enjoy your meal. If they run out of any of those stuffs, just ask but don’t expect them to be nice. You have to do your own cleaning so wash those plates/glasses/utensils. We don’t have a keycard which is something you need to get to the stairs to get to the rooms, and they ddnt give us, maybe because we’re staying for only a night.. but still..  so well, we have trouble getting back up, thank you Indians for being good fellows. We got our bags down and thankfully they allow you to place your baggage in a room downstairs where you can just get it. So far that’s the only good thing since nothing seems touched and nothing was lost when we got back by the end of the day to get our bags even though we had a few things placed just over our them.,…",Budget,,,264,32,100

Amy the front desk lady was quite busy while we waited to check in but she was always smiling and didn't forget to wish us a happy new year the whole time we waited. Although a lot of people were waiting in queue to check-in, she worked very quickly, even seeing a little girl struggling with the entrance door with 4-5 pieces of luggage, she asked me to wait for 2 mins just to help the girl drag her luggage to the counter. A small act, but it also shows that she is a person who cares for each of her guests. I'm just amazed at such a big hotel but I only see her working, Anyway, I had a happy holiday with the hotel. Thank you for providing very good service.,The front desk service is excellent! Had arrived early and they allowed me to check-in without waiting. The room was clean and tidy, The swimming pool for the time being requires booking as well as the gym. Small pool for a cool dip on a hot day! The parking is quite limited but weekday is fine! Nearby there is a food paradise 50 meters walk to Sunshine Plaza, lots of small restaurants. A good place for a few days of staycation and sightseeing walkabout. Overall, my stay was good.,SHN is on-going for this hotel together with staycation. Staycation is for 6th to 9th floor. Below is for SHN. The management image shown here is for Hotel Bencoolen @ Hong Kong Street, NOT for Hotel Bencoolen @ Bencoolen street.  Now, the review for hotel Bencoolen @ Bencoolen Street. Many connecting rooms. Deluxe comes with king bed and bathtub. Most of the rooms no good view as the view is blocked by the next door high building. Parking is limited, 5 to 6 parking lots. The carpark gate would close at 9pm. If u coming later, do phone them to open the gate. The carpark is very squeezy, be careful when opening your doors. Once you have passed Bras Brasah MRT, turn right into rendezvous hotel. Then continue stiraght. Hotel Bencoolen @ Bencoolen street would be at the right. Turn, into the carpark and you may park your cars there.   Room comes with bathtub. Water handle cracked in one of the rooms. Soundproof was very bad. Even can hear intimacy next door at late hours.   Lobby looks grand. The lift looks like the 90s lift. Once you have reached your hotel level, the lift door opens, you would be greeted with a spooky dark corridor, very dim light and scary if you are alone.    In one of our rooms, the aircon was super cold, even we turned it to 28 degree, it was still super cold.   There is a older man who is very friendly. He was always greet you and smile at you when he sees you. He walks around the lobby as well as the carpark.  Under the covid-19 pandemic, the hotel requires all guests to fill up their declaration form. You would have to declare if you have close contact with c+ for the last 14 days. You also need to declare when was your last PCR and ART test and what is the result. Then you would need to sign on it.,…,I had a staycation at hotel Bencoolen last week, it is near Bugis area where we can comfortably shop and enjoy delicious food, although the hotel is a bit old but the room is still acceptable, especially I really like the hotel's mattress it was very soft and gave us a good night sleep. The hotel lobby is always greeted with a warm welcome as well as smiles and greetings of concern where we went and what we ate by the front desk Ms. Amy and the security uncle, which made us feel like we were at our own house. In particular, Amy always accommodate my needs while my wife and I were there, even one day the door's key could not open, she went up and down countless times to change the key even she tried her master key still didn't work, she finally informed my room lock the battery, is dead. More specifically, she went down to take equipment to help us change the door lock battery when the maintenance guys were end work earlier. It amazes me that a receptionist can do this in such a zealous state and always smiling when it's almost 11pm night. Her smile when helping us as well as her apology when the door could not be opened made us very satisfied with the hotel's service. We will definitely be back one day soon. Thank you!,…,I stayed over the weekend on 27 March 2021 (sat)   We celebrated my daughter's birthday at Hotel Bencoolen.

Me and my judith arrived at Hotel 81 dickson and were greeted by the lovely Fann Wong who gave us a cheeky little smirk upon arrival! throughout our stay we cracked jokes him and he made us chuckle on many occasions. one day on our magnificent trip i misplaced judith but rest assure as i was leaving pool area after a cheeky little cat nap i found fann wong and my wife as you know her having a cheeky flirt. I that day was wearing the hotels slippers and fluffy dressing gown on the lobbys marble floor and was so shock by the sight of judith and fann wong in front i slipped and yes im not proud everyone saw including the cleaner (kit, chan) who had just cleaned the floor bless her! On one of the evening me and judith booked a restaurant on the hotel complex. It all started so lovely we were having little chuckles until the salmon came out i felt my throat tightening and my cheeks started to expand. As i looked to my left i noticed judith was horrified at the sight of me and let me tell you it wasn't in a cheeky way at all! By this point it all clicked i had eaten something i am allergic to! in this moment i thought to myself could be fann wong trying to get rid of me? Apart from that incident me and judith did enjoy sitting by the pool area with my rubber dingy. (see photo below) But what we found remarkable was everyday without fail when we came to reserve our sunbeds there would deven sat there with a cheeky little smirk watching. Now im not the most confident in my pot belly body but this made me loose all confidence in myself. i noticed he started having sneaky yes you heard me sneaky little photoshoots around the pool, me and judith thought this was not right and did contemplate pushing him of his high horse!

Rate reasonble..near to my favourite seafood restaurant. Friendly staffs. 10 mins from the bus terminal. Room doesnt serve breakfast so breakfast are usually taken from the street coffee shops.,I am a travel agent and have sent quite a few people to this hotel, but this was my 1st time stay in this hotel. I have visited Singapore 6 times and have stayed in 6 different hotels so I know quite a lot about hotels and their amenities in Singapore.  Some people cannot accept the fact Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world and not just Asia. Malaysia and Thailand are its neighbor and most people coming to Singapore expect the hotels to be similar to those two countries.  I was reading some of the comments and people have complained about rude staff. I say to them Welcome to Singapore. Over the years Singapore from being a tourist friendly destination has become home of Asian Snobs. Rudeness and cold staff behavior is now a part of Singapore culture.  , Rudeness is across all segments. I have seen rude behavior across all categories from luxury to moderate segment. Hopefully the Pandemic Crisis will teach them a lesson that Customer is God.   Singapore behaves very badly with Indian Tourists. I have seen people walking off their seat in a bus when I sat beside her.  Singapore should realize that their Tourism probably earns the most from Indian tourist and they should respect because we are paying and boosting their economy.  Coming back to the hotel. The hotel is very conveniently located. The Jalan Besar MRT is just 200 meters from the hotel. If you want to reach the airport by MRT it takes 1 change of train and just 30 to 40 minutes maximum.   There is a 24 hour Indian restaurant right outside the hotel. There are a couple of Dimsum restaurants and Chinese food court type restaurant nearby.  The mustafa shopping center and Little India is just 1 kilometer which is actually walkable.  The hotel room, the basic category has tv, fridge, electric kettle, comfortable bed.  Yes the room is windowless which is common is budget hotel in Singapore. A window room honestly does not provide any great view either so no point spending money on it.  A very big add on is they have a water filter in the lobby where you can refill water which is a big saving.  Do not fall for the room with breakfast plan because it is way too expensive. The restaurants outside the hotel offer good food at great price.,…,Good location, Near to Little and Rocher MRT station Lot of Indian hotels nearby. Shopping places nearby.

Rooms are spacious and quiet and could be improved by having reading lamps and bed tables on BOTH sides of the bed. Pool is big enough to swim properly and very clean. There is no concierge but a helpful travel agent in the lobby. Many food options at all budgets within walking distance.,Had a lovely time with family at this Hotel.Rooms are very spacious compared to other hotels.Afforadable price. There are many food restaurant and nearby shops near the hotel. The staff are very helpful.Very prompt service. Nana was a really nice girl in reception . We asked for iron board, extra pillow and got it in a jiffy.Highly recommend it.Just notepad was missing,since i always write down a note before leaving.Overall great expereince ,will come back again.  Mehrin from Bangladesh,big rooms, loads of space, great value compared to other places, service very friendly and good. Swee Heng bakery in Haig Av market and food centre nearby is good if you don't want curry and spciy food fr breakfast  Chose it because it also has a pool but pool really needs cleaning or filtration equipment needs to be used properly. Pigoens bathe in pool, area could do with netting.  Hotel is a bit far from MRT for small kids unless you have pushchair. MRT area has plenty of food and drinks choices also  Som guests a bit noisy but were quiet when asked to shut up","Quiet,Family",,,113,14,85
Drop Inn Singapore,4.5,83 reviews,#87 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Russian, Chinese, Indonesian","Share, ,Excellent location, only a few minutes walk from the mrt station and pretty central for everything going on in the city. The room is simple and you get what you pay for but does the job and no complaints,We stayed from 30 May for 3 nights as a group of 6 friends travelling and the reception was almost invisible and she barely speaks English. We only see her once and the cleaning man was much seem to do nothing. No one check us in, we were given a code by message. During our check out, a reception came in at around  8am and asked how was our stay. We noticed the bathrooms were scrubbed and they had people busy cleaning the ceiling, stairways, hover everywhere.  A friendly fresh face reception lady, Lora, who speaks perfect English with us, and told us she has to come in and save the hostel back from all the bad reviews. She said they have not had luck with an excellent full time staffs and most did not take cleanliness as a priority and were hungry for their commissions.  We, check in again on 17 June after our Bintan trip for one night before our flight home, and what a contrast! They painted the rooms wall, and the toilet are cleaned everyday, the waste bins are emptied and no hairs on the bed room floor! We are so glad on our returning stay and Drop INN Singapore Hostel is really true to its words. When they said they are improvising they indeed are! The place is clean. Recommended for friends, families and even female travellers! Lora told us about what to do nearby and the small secret places in Singapore to visit and we wish we met her during our first day! Well, I guess there's a next reason for us to be back again to Singapore, lol! Thank you for making our goodbye stay a perfect wrap up for our Singapore trip. Salute!,…,Booked 3 nights here as it was the cheapest accommodation we could find for 2 people. Email was sent with codes for entry as there was no one onsite when we arrived for check in (5pm). Anytime we were in the hostel there was no one at the front desk so if you had any problems there was no one to help. We thought rooms appeared clean until people checked out of our dorm and new people arrived and the “cleaner” had not changed the bed sheets just re made the bed- not impressed!! Also our dorm could fit 6-8 people, with 2 other rooms on the same floor. We had to share one toilet and one shower between all of us and usually if people were using the shower the toilet was not accessible. It was only on the second day we found another toilet downstairs- something we may have known, sooner if there was someone at the front desk to help! The code for opening the dorm room did not always work so sometimes it took a few minutes to get in. This was quite annoying especially at nighttime, as every time you enter the code it makes a noise. The hostel provided no lockers for valuables which is also a huge negative for us and meant we didn’t feel safe leaving some of our belongings in the room while we were out during the day. Lockers are a basic requirement in any hostel and should be present for all guests. Finally, I am not sure if these 2 men worked here but they arrived into the dorm on the second night and just laid down on someone else’s bed and only moved when that person returned to the room. Did this mean they were lying on our beds too when we were out during the day?  Very very strange set up for a hostel in such a developed city and unfortunately I would not recommend it.,…,The hostel is at good location, walking distance to various MRT stations and central location to various interesting places by grab. The group/family room is located downstairs which is convenience for family with kids. The room was clean, comfy bed, however air-conditioning not working well and not cool at all, it will need service to improve the ventilation in the room. Do note that no towel provided but with rental of $2/towel and no shampoo/soap in the bathroom. There is free flow of hot water and coffee which is great. Free wifi was helpful.,Singapore is a tough country for hostels. We get it. However, it doesn't change standards for cleanliness and thoughtfulness that can be applied to any business. Let may up front, the staff was lovely. Very friendly, always helpful. It just seems like there is not enough staff or they are not being directed appropriately. The location IS very convenient for getting to several MRT stations. Upon checking in the floor of the room was dirty and the sheets and pillowcases for both beds had not been changed. The attendant in the lobby got right on it and changed the sheets. Our room had a fan and AC. The fan did not work. The first night we realized our bed had a twin sized blanket on it. It worked out because it's WARM in Singapore. The staff resolved it immediately the following, day. The bathrooms seemed to be out of toilet paper the majority of the time. The shower upstairs had no door on its stall, and leaked profusely from its joints. Also, the breaker blew upstairs every time someone turned the heater on for the upstairs shower water. This was likely because every room had their aircon units on. The cleanliness overall was not bad, but it was not good enough to have an enjoyable experience showering and using the toilet. The aircon did work well overall in keeping the room nice and cool for us to return to. As much as it may hurt because lodging is expensive in Singapore, spend a couple extra bucks and do no stay here. With a little more TLC, this place would be really nice. Thank you for the hospitality.,…",Budget,,,94,15,89
Royal Lodge @ Pagoda Street,4.0,62 reviews,#90 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,We went to singapore for short escape, originally i was really amazed with this neat and modern country. Despite some people that we meet on the street was not really nice, but the ladies who in charge in the hotel were different things. Both of them are having smiley faces and willing to provide you with any information, especially ms.ayu who didn't mind to be bothered in the late evening after her working hours and have to help us with the password on the enterance door which we totaly forget. For the budget tourist, this is very recomended hostel, it was clean, walkong distance to public transportation and located in the china street you would never starving and broke 😄😄,Pros: 1. Location close to MRT 2. Quiet 3. Room, bathroom and public area are relatively Clean 4. Stay in attic room so more spacious.  Cons: 1. Hidden cost no.1 bec you have to pay $2 for adapter. The hostel use Type G power plug and does not have any power adapter even in a public area. 2. Hidden cost no.2. Breakfast not served in the hostel. You have 2 choices to go to local Kopi Tiam and only provide a toast or other choices but you have to pay for your coffee or tea. Coffee and Tea only free in the hostel. Very inconvenience compare to other hostels in Singapore where breakfast being served in the hostel and unlimited. 3. Staffs: a mixed bag. Check In staff was not the pleasant. Check out staff was  pleasant 4. Staff only stay until 19.00 so if your have a late flight you, can only leave your luggage till that time. Another inconvenient. 5. Bunk bed too short for tall person to rest comfortably. 6. Old power plug not working properly. 7. Stay in Attic room while more spacious it means have to crawl up to level 3.   Summary: For $32 (Other hostels around $26-28) with hidden cost incurred (gotta buy power adapter $2 for charging in Singapore only) and inconvenient being not able to leave your luggage after 19.00 and limited breakfast (not served in the hostel), there are so many  other hostels around  that will provide more value, convenient, friendly and,…,Hotel is located in Chinatown and easy to walk around, staff was friendly when they helped us to take MRT. Maybe for security so they require password to enter hotel and room, sometime I felt uncomfortable due to we shared room with other. Shower rooms are small and poor breakfast, we must walk down to train station to find their place for breakfast.,This hotel you got based on price selling. 1 room they have 12 person in there, some guest have disturb taking at night. Can’t sleep, for breakfast they work with cafe near with hostel only 3 choice of meals you can take, drink is charge. Wifi no problem, bathroom need refill the body soap.  ,Cozy hostel, small space - stairs and breakfast area, great location - it's located in chinatown and very near the mrt exit A.  *i was in singapore last october 14, and i think maple lodge was change to ""royal hostel"" something (not so sure of the name)","Centrally Located,Budget",,,686,111,100
ibis budget Singapore Imperial,3.5,397 reviews,#191 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,English,"Share, ,Me and my wife stayed in this Hotel for 3 Nights and 4 Days (1st June 2015 to 4th June 2015). Purpose of this Trip was purely to explore Singapore.   Its really a great surprise when you reach Hotel (Late Check-In) and to know that you have been upgraded from Superior Room to Deluxe Room with Window on 4th floor near the Swimming Pool.  I completely agree with majority of TripAdvisor Members, this Hotel is definitely a good choice for those who don't want to enjoy the hotel property but explore Singapore. Its clean, great and safe location for family, couples, ladies and excellent Staff- Zenn, Lee, Helenna and a lady with initial M etc.   I must mention here the Star- Zenn- He is the man who welcomes his guests with his all time smiling face!!! He is very helpful- right from, guiding us about Places, Restros, MRT Routes etc. He will surely go beyond your expectations which you might have from a hotel staff, to help the guests in every possible way. I saved a good time because of his guidance (though my itinerary for Singapore was all planned but still you need a guidance).    This Hotel is just 2-3 Min walk from MRT Lavender Station (Green Line) which can be reached directly from the Changi Airport (you will have to change a train at MRT Tana Merah Station which is not a hasle and easily accessible with a luggage). From Changi Airport to Hotel it took me 25 Min for about SG$1.60 per head.   All other best places in Singapore like MRT Bayfront (Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay), MRT Raffles City (Merlion Park, Fullerton Hotel), MRT Quarke Quay (perfect for night life), Harbour Front (Sentosa, Universal Studio), China Town etc. are at the MRT distance of 5-20 Min which will cost you in an range from SG$0.90- SG$1.70 per head.  Little India (for Indian Food Lovers specially Veggies) and Mustafa Centre (24 Hrs open) are 15 Min walk from the Hotel.  Only thing to note for prospective guests- Rooms are bit small but definitely worth a prize when your purpose is to explore Singapore, because you will hardly be in the Room/Hotel.  About Must Visit Places in Singapore:  1.Marina Bay Sands, 2.Gardens By the Bay, 3.Merlion Park,  4.Quarke Quay (Best for Night Life but most Restros closes by 2am- Try TCC- Jong, a Staff of TCC, Turkish Ice-Cream)  5.Take a cruze 40 min ride from Quarke Quay to Mairna Bay  6.Singapore Flyer (you can skip this if you are visiting Marina Bay Sands)   7.Marina Bay Shopping Mall (June is a mid-year sale time)  8.China Town  9.Orchard Road  10.Sentosa (Major attractions- SEA Aquarium, SkyRide and Luge, 4D Extreme Long Ride, Tiger Sky Ride and Wings of Time (2 shows 7.40pm and 8.40pm) can be done in a half day 2pm-8pm ).  11.Universal Studio (Due to flight delays, I decided to skip this and chose to explore more place than spending an entire day at Studio- which i believe was the best decision).  12.Jerong Bird Park (recomm for Kids)  Please note that all the MRT Trains stop running by Midnight i.e. 12am.   Taxis are easily available, if you have GPS activated there are less chances of drivers taking you for a ride- From the Hotel majority of places are in range of SG$ 4-20 by a Taxi (4 people).  Suggestion for Hotel- Please change Display Picture of the Hotel on this website, because the Hotel looks better in reality.  Hotel Fragrance Imperial- Thank you for a great and memorable stay!!! Looking forward to visit you again...   Best wishes, Varun Shah email: varun.shaha@gmail.com,…,We checked in this hotel last November 24 and November 29 2013. We got a family room for 3 adults. The room is a bit small but enough for an overnight stay since we only used this hotel for our pre and post cruise accommodation. The room and bathroom are clean. The hallway smells good.  What I like most about this hotel is the location. It's a five-minute walk to the EW11 Lavender (green) station and so it's very easy for you to go around the city. In Singapore, it's much cheaper to use the train than to get the taxi. We went to Mustafa Centre for shopping, which is around 15-20 minute walking.   If you're a Filipino, it might be very convenient for you as most of the staff are Filipinos! Hurray for no language barrier! They were all helpful and friendly. They suggest you where, to eat and go shopping.  There's breakfast included. The restaurant (The Good News Restaurant) is downstairs. They don't serve rice. Anyway there are nearby hawker centres and food stores for variety. There's also a 7 eleven outside the hotel. Very convenient if you need to buy something late at night.,…,I have been here on 13th Oct 16 , hotelier was very rude , We arrived at 0730 am the hotel was fully empty still they dint gave us the rooms. they gave us rooms at 1500 hrs, the breakfast was terrible.,Fragrance Hotel  Fragrance Hotel - Imperial is at a pretty good location, two short blocks from the MRT - Lavender station. Lavender station is only two stops from the main business district and is on the same line that goes to the Changi Airport.  If you come onto the airport after midnight the MRT is not running so a taxi is the main option. $28Sing including the 50% surcharge for late night fare.   The hotel is basic, as reflected in the price (considering it's Singapore)  but has a nice roof top pool, good for laps but not a fancy pool.  Nice clean room but small, I didn't stay in the room much but is was good enough.    The best part was the staff, I didn't catch the names of the others that helped me, always with a smile, but Lee was one who I did get his name he was great, as where all of the other staff.  They gave me a room with a window, although it didn't open, the AC was perfect so not an issue.  When I had a problem with the shower they promptly have me another room and when I couldn't print my train ticket, the lady behind the counter took whatever steps needed to get a paper ticket in my hand. Any hotel can have issues but the staff here took care of me with a smile. ,…,Extremely inhospitable and racist  Cafeteria guys denied water to elderly women as she had stepped out of cafeteria after finishing her breakfast.

It was perfect for a family stay with everything in a walking distance. Jumbo seafood, main outlets of Song Fah bak out the were almost the the doorstep, and mrt station around 50-100 meters away. We could walk to Chinatown and Maxwell Food court. Riverwalk, Clark Quay and all the fun it provides were available to us on foot.  The accommodation provided very functional kitchen, great bathroom and washer/dryer. The  cable with 150+ channels along with fast WiFi came as a bonus.   We loved our stay here and will be back. ,I stayed in the Singa apartment for two weeks over Christmas with my daughter and loved it. It is a very bright spacious apartment with tall ceilings in a fantastic location just a few minutes away from Clark Quay station and about a 6/7 minute walk to Chinatown MRT. Some water was left in the fridge for the first week which was very handy.  The Bluetooth speakers were a nice touch and played both downstairs and in the upstairs bedroom. It was also handy to have a washing machine and dryer  which is a must if you travel light. The management are very responsive to any issues. I hope to stay here again when I return to Singapore.,We stayed in apartment Yellow Flame on the 4th floor, which has a small balcony overlooking the street. Nice for a bevvie after a big day trekking :) The location could not be better. 2 minute walk to MTR, to shops and food and to Quayside with awesome bars and restaurants along the river. 10 minute walk to Chinatown. But honestly, wherever you want to go, if the train isn't your thing, $10 in a Grab (private taxi) Little bar and restaurant down stairs. Candy who works there is so lovely and super helpful :) and a 7/11 store across the street :) Apartment itself is lovely. Compact, with everything you could possibly need:) The only negative thing I can say,but is not really a big deal, is for a 2 bedroom apartment, there is only 1 mirror,which is in the bathroom. Put an extra, mirror in the place, and I score it a 10 out of 10. Thank you for an awesome stay :),…,Fabulous location, Lovely rooms (Singa apartment), clean, tidy, not much of a view, but who cares ... It's in the right place!!

The Great Madras,3.5,98 reviews,#127 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Malay","Share, ,When we checked in, our room was not cleaned with the previous guests wet towels all over... it was horrifying. The room also did not come with any phone to call reception,  which is literally supposed to come with a 2* hotel but this is a 3*... might as well be classified as 1*. Air con wasn't working... was set at 19 degrees but feels so warm like 25 degrees. I think the experience with the toilet was the worst as its still wet with used toilet paper and the previous guests dripping wet towels ... Completely unacceptable...  Went to the receptionist to complain and she did not apologize not even once and just asked if we wanted a refund. Initially we didn't want to as its hard to find a same-day hotel booking on a PH within our budget , but she made us feel so unwelcome as, guests that we ended up just cancelling our booking. She said excuses like the hotel is lacking manpower thats why the room was not cleaned. Like I don't expect the room to be all sparkles but the least they could do was make the room free of the previous guests stuff? Was very disappointed and the worst hotel experience I've been to. While I appreciated the hotel for honoring the refund, it is not someplace I will recommend to anyone.,…,Mr. Sasheed ensured our arrival and check-in process goes smoothly and it did! We were super happy and contented with his customer service and we wish him the best! Thank you for having him in the business. (:,I've travelled a fair bit and stayed in many hotels; I would say the receptionist at this property is the most unwelcoming front desk I've ever encountered.  And that was how my staycation began.  This is a boutique hotel near little India. Good location with mrt station nearby and lots of small restaurants and cafes in the surrounding. However, building is a little run down.  For longer stay travelers, note that there is no closet and no hangers provided. The room has very little space to hang your clothes/towels etc. Shower drainage was bad, and sink was leaky. We stayed in the suite that comes with a huge bath tub which is the only plus point.  It was bearable for a one night stay, but once is more than enough.,If you’d ask me to give a rating of The Great Madras, I think I would give a three out of five. The hotel really has great potential! Despite being in the middle of nowhere, I believe the property has enough flair and poise to retain its reputation. It’s beautiful, inside and out. Architecture? Good! Interior design? Goood! Affordable? Goood!  The hotel is now managed by HOTEL CALMO, which is another boutique hotel in Bugis I believe. I have not been there so I can’t comment or elaborate about their culture of service yet, but I think it’s great that another management is continuing the legacy of this heritage building, rather than leaving it to dilapidate.  Do read my blog for the FULL review. Link is on my TripAdvisor profile!,Loved this retro-themed hotel so much! Service, room and amenities were awesome. Especially loved the pool ♥️Jerry at the concierge was especially accommodating, unlocking the pool gates several times and turning on the neon lights, accommodating a room change a floor down, helping to bring a delivery up to the pool area. Got the Great Suite which had an gorgeous pastel interior and a large round tub which can comfortably accommodate 2 adults - probably about 1.5m in diameter. The shower area is closed off and separate. The room windows look out into the pool area. The pool itself is small but very charming. It’s sad that the bistro and barber are closed due to covid - would love to drop by for drinks some time! There are 2 coin-operated washers & dryers in the hotel lobby area.",,4833,Booking.com,263,52,100

I visited this place once, and thought of the kindness of the staff and the cozy room of the room, so I found this place again. I stayed for a long time on my second visit. If I visit Bangalore again, I would rather stay here. All Asians, Westerners, and Indians spend the day talking together. Room rates are too cheap, and breakfast is very delicious. It is so popular that you can't find your desired room without making a reservation a week ago. Five stars are insufficient. I want to give ten stars. There is a good reason for having a high grade!,Affordable for backpackers. The hostel has free bread and jams and coffee for breakfast. Rooms are very clean and tidy. It has 2 shared toilets and 2 shared shower rooms. A flat iron is available free of charge. Power sockets though was a problem as they are not compatible with the usual male plugs (I guess it is true all over Singapore). You might want to buy an adaptor outside or bring with you one if you plan to travel to Singapore. The location by the way is within the city area, and near the bars at Clarke Quay.,The location is damn perfect, very close to the central mall and Clarke quay mrt station. If you are familiar with the buses system in Singapore there're a lot of buses near the hostel!

We wanted to withdraw money from an atm but he didn’t want to wait because we arrived “late” and he was about to sleep. Excuse me? if your service finish at 22:00 don’t let me book it!!! Practically he invited us to find another hostel and everything was closed at 24:00 becoming my night not precisely in a good night. Besides he didn’t offer any alternative such as pay the day after and keep our passports in order to make sure we pay. We were very upset due to this impoliteness.

Broadway Hotel Singapore,3.0,224 reviews,#231 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Wifi,"English, Malay","Share, ,For your own safety and peace of mind, DO NOT STAY AT BROADWAY HOTEL.   A hotel employee by the name of John Teoh attempted to coerce his way into my room at 1 am in the morning by unlocking the door with a traditional metal turnkey to open the door. He was unable to enter because I had locked the chain, and ran away quickly when he realised I was still awake. He claimed that he intended to deliver something to a guest on a different floor, but this does not explain why he had the correct turnkey for my room, why he did not knock on the door and why he did not in fact have anything in his hands to deliver.   It is never acceptable under any circumstances to enter a guest's room without their EXPRESS consent that late at night, and it is disgusting, repulsive behaviour when you, consider the fact that I was a young, female solo traveller that had trusted this accommodation to value the safety and health of its guests. The management's (delayed) response was a lacklustre apology and a statement that they had given the person a ""serious warning"". The owner, Mrs Sim, even laughed at me and said that ""hey, no harm was done after all"". This is in spite of the fact that they are yet to identify the original guest that had allegedly requested an item and therefore have no alternative explanations for the actions of their employee.  This is not an appropriate response to the severity of the situation. While I am still uncertain of what his true intentions are (theft, rape, voyeurism etc.), the attempts of a male employee to forcibly enter the room of a female guest at 1 am is shocking and distressing. They said that they would ""consider"" firing the employee in question, which is equal to saying that they have decided to do nothing.  In terms of my actual stay, I found it difficult to enter my bathroom at night because there are tiny cockroaches swarming all over the sink, the toilet, the shower. I found larger cockroaches outside on my floor mat and crawling up the door frame on both nights that I stayed there. The safe provided did not function and was not bolted down. Wifi is $6/day and can only be used on a single device at any given time. Broadband is slow. TV channels not worth looking at (excessive static on most of the 9 channels provided). Staff is unprofessional, unfriendly and unhelpful.  There are much better options out there, and I strongly suggest that you take the time to find them because this hotel is not worth your hard earned money.,…,After some of the reviews I had read about some of the cheaper hotels in Singapore, I wasn't expecting too much.  Coming to the end of a 5 month trip I was on quite a tight budget and was happy with the Broadway.  It's location in Little India probably isn't the best place to be in Singapore, but is a very short walk to Farrer Park MRT station.  Only bad thing is the noise at night, I was on the street side which obviously made it worse, so ask for one at the back of the hotel if possible.  The traffic noise and shouting etc didn't die down every night until around 4am!  Also showerhead in bath was broken and had to be held whilst trying to wash your hair!  Room was however clean, well equipped with kettle, TV, aircon etc and was of a decent size.  Would recommend to people on a, budget who are just in Singapore for a few days and want to use their room as a base.  Would stay here again. ,…,Located in Little India, with bus transport at the front door and Farrer Park MRT 8 mins walk. The room size was ok but the unnecessary and filthy stained overly large slumber chair in the room was both a waste of space and time placed in the room.  Sleep quality was actually good, with a sufficiently long bed, I had read other travellers comments and asked for a room facing the back of the hotel, it was most certainly quieter. The front rooms would have coped a lot of noise, windows open which is an advantage.  Bathroom layout pretty bad and the show head needs repair.  Stayed 3 nights Internet was ok. The property however has very poor street appeal and although it was tired was clean enough, except for the chair in the room. Limited hanging space.  The $10 food voucher per, night’s stay used at the restaurant in front of the hotel is a good touch and the restaurant food quality was good.  Ease of access to taxis is very good. Location in Little India also excellent,…,Loved the rooms ,Beds are comfortable and size good for family of 2-3.Strongly Recommended for family with Kids Ferar Park LRT/MRT and Broadway BUS stops are few steps away Shopping and indian food paradise Hotel Easily accessible from everywhere,traveled February 2015 with family. we had a short stay for 4 nights in singapore and we wanted to be close to Mustafa Mall. booked online and the rent is very reasonable in terms of Singapore. when we arrived there the room size was a bit small then i expected. though it was ok, it was clean. The staffs were nice. Very close to mustafa, mrt, bus stop at the door step. overall it was a comfortable stay. Lastly i want to thank the indian guy (sorry i could not recall his name) helped us to find a taxi while leaving for airport. :)","Centrally Located,Mid-range",,,354,41,100
Hotel 81 Elegance,3.0,213 reviews,#234 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,This cannot be called a hotel...  When you enter your ""room"" you will find a 11 square meters place with no window and no furniture. The bed is a piece of plastic covered buy the thinest layer of cotton.Like any good warehouse, it also has it centralized AC as noisy as a truck, which temperature you cannot control as it is centralized.  During the night you can hear the sweet sounds of either prositutes having s*x next door or the housekeeping lady pushing her trolley and slamming doors as it is a 24 hours service. MRT station is a 15 min walk away which is not that close. You have to pay 10SGD for a Wi-Fi connection/per day.  And all that fantastic package for 75$/night !!!!!!!! BE CAREFUL with the taxes that are not included on most online travel website.  I love Singapore so, much but was sooo disappointed with the expensive rates of hotels, this one in particular completely RUINED our stay.   Think about website like rbnb which offers great place to stay with breakfast, lovely people, great location and cheap price. We moved to one of the places provided by the website after sleeping at Hotel 81 and we felt revigorated !!!  To conlude: AVOID THIS HOTEL LIKE PLAGUE !!!,…,I stayed in this hotel because it was near the MRT stations and shopping.  The room was ok and the staff excellent. I walked to Little India and found lots of trinkets to bring home.  The food was also proved right.  The hotel is in a very good location.,Just got back from Singapore with my family (2 Adults, 2 Kids) for a short trip.  Choose this hotel from the review from Tripadvisor, so give it try.  Got the Twin Bedded room with a window. Checking in was fast and easy, the girl working at the front desk is helpful enough to provide me information to move around with public transport. She even provide me a map.   Anyway, Hotel 81 are well-known in Singapore, so this property is something different from other Hotel 81 outlet. This outlet located in Jalan Besar, which is quite near to city centre. I tried taking cab from Orchard Road back to hotel, it's only cost me SGD 8!   Let me summarize this Hotel 81 - Elegance  Pros: 1) Very reasonable price hotel (compare to other 2-3 Star hotel in Singapore) 2) Clean and tidy room 3), Great shower 4) A lot of eateries stall nearby and convenient stall too (Cheers and 7-11) 5) This hotel is quiet, as it's at the back of the main road, so no worries on the traffic part 6) Buses to Orchard/Bugis/Sim Lim Square is just right in front of the hotel (Bus No.65) 7) Lavender MRT station is just 5-6 min walk (this MRT station can connect to Changi Airport) 8) Free parking to those who drive in from Malaysia, but it's a first come first serve basis (there is only 6 carpark lot behind this hotel) 9) WiFi in the room and lobby is fast.  Cons: 1) Room is a bit old, i guess need a bit of minor touch up 2) Toilet is small (but i guess that's norm in Singapore budget hotel) 3) Floor is a bit sticky perhaps the housekeeping need to pay attention on that matter 4) Pillow is a bit too soft for my liking 5) Only provide 2 towel, i was hoping for an extra face towel 6) My room phone doesnt work, so i couldnt contact to front desk to get an extra pillow  Overall, this hotel is worth a try.,…,Hotel 81 was such a disappointing experience for me. Over 80 euros per night I believe is far too overpriced for what is essentially a hostel. The noise at night and very early in the mornings was just awful. A whole family was staying on my floor, who had no consideration for the other guests and shouted down the corridor, slammed doors, and woke me up at 6am. To top this all off, as soon as they left, the cleaning staff went in and began cleaning and banging around the rooms, at 6am!! I had to phone the reception and kindly ask for them to return at a decent time.  The room also smelt stale from the lack of windows and the air conditioner was essentially forced upon me. Their system is centralised so every time you want it on/off you have to call reception and ask them to sort, it out.  If you would like a more relaxing stay in Singapore you should definitely pay a bit extra. Alternatively, pay less and stay in a hostel.,…,This hotel is disgusting. Dirty, no windows and located around hookers! The staff were rude, unfriendly and builders were carrying out maintenance at a very early time in the morning. We found pubic hairs in our bed and a friend in the room next door found the same. Don't waste your money with this joke of a place",Budget,,,219,29,91
Heritage Collection,4.0,21 reviews,#124 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,I stayed at the Heritage Collection in Boat Quay from January to May 25th.  I stayed in the premium room overlooking the river.  The room was very comfortable. clean and the king size bed made sleeping a pleasure.  The building and rooms were very well kept and the amazing staff there made sure all my needs were met with 5 star service.  Jarwin in particular was simply amazing.  Very friendly and I applaud his communication via WhatsApp to ensure all his guests were kept up to date with the ever changing lockdown laws and regulations due to the current situation surrounding the pandemic.  Jarwin was friendly, professional and an absolute gentlemen ensuring my stay there was a 5 star experience.  I highly recommend this serviced apartment in Singapore.  Thanks you Heritage, Collection.  I will always book my stay there every time time I visit the magical country of Singapore.,…,The elevator was under service for my entire visit. No WiFi for the first week and lots of excuses as to why this was so: the weather, my devices, .... No TV either!  Eventually the modum was replaced and it was discovered that the Apple remote for the TV had run down batteries. I found all of this annoying and inefficient.,I have stayed them a few times in the past, feels a bit overpriced for the size / quality that you get but I guess that's regular for Singapore. However today I wanted to book again for another stay, and was asking which location is the apartment... but the girl on the phone replied ""we only give you the address once you have completed payment"". This is ridiculous and insulting. Maybe before paying 1200 usd for a week I could at least know where I am booking a room? Needless to say I did not book.,We stayed at the apartment in June. The location was great. Directly by the water. Rooftop bar in the same building. 7 minutes walk to the MRT. The room was very clean and had everything we needed. The host Jarwin took very good care of us. Can definitely recommend! ,I had a great stay here! Room has everything I need, and a kitchenette with a portable cooker enough for me to cook up a light meal. :)   Just a note, not for the light sleepers since it is located along the very happening bars and restaurants which I find it very convenient for myself! Great bars to chill out with the friends! There is a rooftop bar too which offers great views and chill music. If u like to have some drinks and not worry about taking a cab home, this is the place!   The guest relations manager is superb and friendly. Always responding to my request via WhatsApp so promptly!

Penta Hotel,3.5,87 reviews,#229 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Stayed in a double room for 3 nights room only. Offers value for money and location is excellent close to mustafas, MRT and other major supermarkets and stores. Check-in and check-out was a breeze and staff was polite as well. We were able to leave and enter the hotel 24 hours which was not an issue. I would recommend this as a good budget alternative for those visiting singapore.,Very nearest from MRT Ferrar Park, Mostafa Center & Lots of Bangladeshi Restaurents. The Hotel Room is very clean. One observation point is they don't provide prayer mate. Otherwise services are good. I recommend for budgetary traveller.,Thanks Linda and the entire staff for making our stay at Penta Hotel a memorable one.   We stayed in a deluxe family room and it was very spacious and clean and the wash room too was quite large and clean too. The cleaning service was excellent and our room was cleaned daily with the towels changed, bed spreads neatly arranged and vacuumed. The location of the hotel is very convenient close to the MRT station and Mohd. Mustafa Complex. The Reception staff was very flexible and we got a late check-out at a reasonable cost.  We will definitely stay at Penta on our next vacation and would always recommend this hotel to our friends.,Penta is located in Little India, very close to the MRT and Mustafa. The hotel is very basic. Neat and clean and helpful staff for sure, but they have really cut corners ! They do not have even the usual folding stand, on which one can keep one's baggage. No F&B and no electric kettle too. Meant for budget travelers who possibly use the room to sleep at night. The internet is good.,The hotel is walking distance to mrt station and close to a shopping mall. There are many choices for food inside the mall. The room is clean and not smoking smell.

Sunday, they will provided us special free lunch, so delicious😋 ,We stayed here almost 2 months from early May20 due to Covid19, most propably will stay till end of Dec20 subject to boarder measure.  The owner well friendly, helpful, kind negotiable and listened our need during this period.  The staffs also well friendly, helpful, kind and hardworking.  Please maintance the standard and keep up the good works.,We booked this hotel a month ago for a week, they charged huge amount, anyway, we were existed about the trip and ready to enjoy our holidays, however, due to increase number of coronavirus cases in singapore we had to cancel our trip/plan so we called hotel and ask them help us to cancel our booking with refund but they denied the request after that we asked them to adjust the dates so that we can replan our trip when this virus effect slows down in Singapore,they not ready to adjust the dates also. In this chaos, how can we continue our trip to Singapore when virus is spreading like hell, but hotel staff not ready adjust with customer. They are fine if we come, stay and get the virus with us in our country or get sick but they are not ready to adjust dates or provide us any, alternatives. They are charging for Service/facility which we didn't availed. I believe we made a terrible mistake to book this hotel, they are not cooperative and they are not ready to adjust with the situation even when its global emergency. Global Health authorities confirmed that travelling to any affected country is not recommended but this hotel is not ready to help us. I would request you to all before booking this hotel please remember they will never adjust with situation or cooperate with you even if its NOT YOUR FAULT.,…,The four of us stayed here on our visit to singapore. The front desk lady charged or room deposit instead of merely taking a credit card number to charge later in case of damages (this was against policy I discovered later). We stayed in a room with a queen bed and two bunk beds, ensuite bathroom, plus a small balcony. The room was clean and comfortable - all features functioned properly.   The location is far from the main areas of the city and on the other side of singapore from the airport. A subway station is about 10-15 minutes walk away. A bus stop is directly in front of the guesthouse. It's a solid 30 minute trip away from little india or little china.  Being a hostel we had concerns about noise at night but were not bothered by any. We did not utilize the breakfast, option but did eat at the restaurant across the street and found it acceptable.   On checkout I found that they could not refund the deposit. After working with the manager over the next several days she refunded the deposit to me via paypal instead of a credit to my original card. That was not desirable at all, but was the best she said she could do.  On the whole this was a nice stay, I only advise you to be cautious about your room deposit.,…,I stayed there 3 months. Owner/manager was very accommodating and always adjusted to my difficult schedule and my special requests. Everything is clean always, everything is New and working condition.

Lodge 41,4.0,31 reviews,#118 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese","Share, ,Have curtain to cover the bed/bunk bed for privacy which is essential for travellers/guests.  Coffee available 24 hours Friendly staff  At the end of the lane. Can either walk from Kallang MRT station or Aljuneid MRT  but it is a bit far so it can be tough with large bags. Mixed dorm, all ages/gender PLastic doors on toilet mean lack of privacy.,Given the high costs of singapore, we found this place a really good deal in terms of cost. It was kept clean and the dorm beds had curtains so you were able to have some privacy too. The location is good in terms of getting places - Aljuneid MRT station is about 10 minute walk away and from there it’s quick and easy to get anywhere. The free breakfast of toast and spreads did the job and the little kitchen/lounge area is quite pleasant. The staff were friendly and helpful. Only issue was that there wasn’t the best social atmosphere for backpackers due to a strange mix of people - seems there isn’t really a ‘target market’ for this place. Nonetheless, everyone was friendly and we would stay here again. ,Near with bus station, but little bit far from mrt station. The nearest mrt is aljuneid walking around 15-20 minutes. But i prefer take bus to paya lebar mrt station. It's located in red district but it convenient place, clean room, free breakfast, movie room, library.,I made the wrong choice when trying to decide which hostel to book in Singapore and ended up with this place. i cancelled my booking after 1 night  The hostel has a lot of potential which it unfortunately doesn’t take advantage of.  You are first met with perhaps the grouchiest middle aged man ever. I’m not sure if everyone is met by him when they check in because surely if that were the case this hostel wouldn’t make any money. He is rude and seems irritated by everything. The way he speaks to you is as though he’s doing you a huge favour by deigning to handle your booking. He just holds his hand out and grunts at you to give him passports/money/etc. Asking a simple question (about, say, when breakfast starts) leads to an angry response. What a turn off for my stay.  I stayed, in a 12 bed female dorm. It’s on the  top 4th floor so it’s super hot. The room has aircon but it’s switched off between 12-3pm (the hottest part of the day). The aircon is also not very cold and doesn’t reach the beds so at night it’s awful.  The bed itself is uncomfortable and hard. My bed wasn’t cleaned properly (I could tell by the fact that the previous guest’s travelcard was still there). The beds were very thin and rattled at the slightest s movement. The ladder up is also difficult to use as there’s a sign saying not to put your full weight on the railing. Great. And the other guests in the room were very inconsiderate - yelling to each other from one and of the room to the other at 11pm! One girl decided she would snooze her alarm for 1.5hrs so her alarm went off every 10minutes from 5.30am. Wow.  The bathrooms were pretty scummy. Hair and grime everywhere - not sure how often it’s cleaned. Also apparently they provide toiletries but that was only in 1 of the 2 bathrooms in the room. So if you went to the toilet or something in the other bathroom there was no soap for your hands.  Location not that great - but far away from stuff and I think it’s in a red light district? There were a bunch of sex shops around.  The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they provide a towel and the common area is acceptable (though too small for 3 floors of guests). Breakfast was toast and a wide selection of jams which was fine for me but for others may be not very exciting. There was no noise outside at night,…,Lodge 41 may be in red light district but never have I felt so secure and at peace staying any where as I call it ""The Lodge"", lol. But seriously the atmosphere is so relaxing that you feel as if you are at home and can just relax and enjoy yourself without going out of the hostel. The staff is friendly and caring. Transportation to buses is a 5 minute walk and a 10 minute walk to MRT or you can take the bus. Two 24 hour market all within 5-7 minutes away and plenty of restaurants to choose from. I always enjoy my stay when I come there. Thanks Richard, Albert and Rio for being here for people like me.",Budget,,,128,18,68

It was quite comfortable and the environment wasn't noisy (quite peaceful, actually). The toilet was really small so if you're really stocky, you might have a hard time. Overall, everything was okay and this hotel is considered to be one of the more affordable hotels in Singapore.,This place was on one of the main roads towards the Airport not in downtown Singapore area.

It was only $40++ SGD but i regretted not to spend more few dollars on other hostel...My 3 nights stay was horibble and i moved out on the 2nd night.,Stayed at this hostel for a night between my layover from Hong Kong heading to Malaysia, the reception and kitchen rooms are very small and congested, didn't really appeal to me personally as I prefer a common area and more modern facilities. However, I must say the staff service does get a 5-star rating for me as coming in at 1 am the staff member was SUPER helpful, offering me even some food after travelling late night, very nice service.   The dormitory rooms were in a very old style layout and design, it looked more run down to me than old-style but this is more just personal preference, the beds and bunks are a bit hard but for a budget hostel more than fine enough. The showers are a bit weirdly designed in dorms but otherwise, I had no problems staying here with a quick, layover personally.,…,I have travelling for 2 month in Asia and so far this hostel is my worst stay!  I am used to stay in hostels, specially in dorms, but here it was just horrible.   First, the crew is really rude, not friendly at all. It is like you annoyed them to be there.   The hostel atmosphere is not friendly neither! The concept is supposed to be vintage but it is just old and barely clean! Not charming at all. And there is no commun area. Just reception with grumpy crew...  The dorm is maybe the worst. Freezing (and no possibility to control the A/C) and dark.  The only good things is the bed curtain.  And no need to talk about bathroom...small, barely clean, not really hot water...  Finally, even the residents are rude... Avoid this hostel!  ,I give 8.5/10 Overall, the hostel is good. They offer a cheap price. Location is near from MRT farrer park, for me its just 7minutes walk and also you can take bus from MRT farrer park. Around hostel there are pub, but for me, its still safe because the pub start from 11 PM. The free wifi in hostel also works well. The bathroom quite clean. The reason why I give 8.5 is just because the breakfast place is in outside hostel and you have to walk a lil bit and when the pub start to open, you can hear a music from your room.

I told him I'm on car accident m/c. He like don't believe but actually I have proof that he didn't want or see it. I also told him I've stayed in this hotel 2 days ago. He then told me seriously he won't let me stay in because I swapped hotel. I just wanted to tell him I swapped hotel because I want to find out which hotel is more comfortable that's all. But I was told to go off, so sad.,Layla n Alex has been a good treating me n my pregnant wife with a good customer service which they gave me extra blanket n pillow upon my request for my wife comfort. with i see they go extra Mile for us.

They makesure they make us comfortable and they are always smiling . thankyou for your great service will definitely come back here .,Me and my friends stayed Hotel 81 Cherry for 4 nights from 27th april to 1st of may 2018. Hotel rooms were very small without  windows but it was filled with all the facilities we need like hot water, AC, Towels, toothpaste, tooth brush, shower gel, electric jug, cups, hair dryer and tea making mixtures also free Wifi. Room cleaning service was also good and Hotel manager Mr. James Ho was very kind. Hotel is very close to Indian Food Restaurants so we were able to get good food for the best price and it is very close to Kallang MRT Station as well. Though Geylang is very popular as a red light district, we didn't see any prostitute around the hotel even at the night. Anyway during our stay, at one night we heard weird noises from a nearby room ( like sex noises) and it was quite, uncomfortable to hear others having sex. Regardless of that hotel is a good place to stay for the travelers who are having limited budget.,…,This is the first time and family and I stayed here and was being greated warmly by your Hotel Manager Mr James Ho. He interacted guest in a professionalism style. Cherry is fortunate to have a leader like him. Cheers.",,,,65,7,76

It is located just within walking distance from Farrer Park. You cant miss it, Exit E and voile, it is just so near.  Reception : The reception area is very small and smell of shoes a lot. I think they should put the shoe rack somewhere else because it makes the area so smelly. The Indian reception lady is arrogant and glib. She served us with not a single amount of smile of caring tone. She is flat toned and very rude. She tried to pin the blame to me during our confusion about bed. I almost exploded that time. Stupid lady.  Room : I stayed in so many hostel / capsule but this one is by far second worst. Thanks god. the room is so jam packed and one room has almost 24 or maybe 30 beds. The ""capsule"" is not even private, for people sleeping on the top bunk. kidding me or what eh?? Close the top bunk.  Cleanliness : Kitchen cleanliness : sad. balcony cleanliness : okay ish. Common area with tv : too many dirty linens. Walkways : Dusty.  Breakfast : The kitchen size is mini. How do you expect 30 people to fit in? And there is no simple cereal there.  Bathroom : Dirty.  Satisfaction : Naaahhh.  Recommendations : Stay somewhere else.,…,Near to MRT , Please use gate no ""E"" to reach the place , its 4 min walk .. Bring your own Towel , soap and toilet kit , they serve basic breakfast    not near to any attraction but you can access through MRT , You need to get down to Ferrar Park,,Don't expect much as it is a hostel.

ABC Hostel @ Hamilton,2.0,12 reviews,#269 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,Pertama kalinya backpacker ke luar negeri karena ingin menonton konser. Harga lumayan mahal karena peak season dan berbarengan dengan acara F1 GP Singapore. Kurang nyaman karena kamar laki-laki dan perempuan tidak terpisah. Lumayan jauh dari MRT Lavender. No private bath room.,The Host is arrogant, the room smells really bad. Water Ok, 10 room guest quite silent but the smell of humid won t let you sleep. When you check always the same story: the machine doesn' t work and you have to pay by cash... So booking.com says that they pre charge you 50% and the host says pay all by cash.. Ask them an email with your invoice ,Me and a friend landed in Singapore at 2 am and, after our host for the night left us hanging, we had to roam around Lavender Street looking for a hostel with available beds. After knocking at 4 hostels (none of them had available beds) we were directed into ABC. We walked up the stairs and indeed we were welcomed by men without shirts. However, he was really nice, making us a lower price on the bed because we were arriving so late and were leaving before noon the next day. Additionally, after a little bargaining (because he wanted us both to sleep in the same bed – they were double pods), he gave us a pod each. The pod had a few stains, but it looked ok. We had brought our own sheets but he provided us with towels and a blanket. The mattress was quite comfortable and we slept, just fine. And he even borrowed us a bit of tooth paste since we both forgot ours. The next day we even left later than we were supposed to and there was no problem at all. There was free wifi with very good coverage into the rooms. There were two toilets and two showers unisex. We had to go through the lobby to reach them, but they were clean and the water had good pressure. Overall, it was a suitable and affordable solution for two budget travelers.,…,Cheap & convenient, close to the Lavender MRT stop. Capsule style beds offer more privacy compared to traditional type dorms. AC in room was ice cold which is great considering how hot & humid it is in Singapore. Bed felt a bit worn but still comfy.  Now for the negative points. I was expecting to see the usual hip, young backpacker crowd here but instead I found lots of shirtless old asian men hanging around the common areas. Not sure if they were guests or employees. They don't really bother guests but for some reason I felt a bit uneasy around them.  Kitchen area was way too small & cramped. Hardly any seating area to enjoy my food. No space to put my bowl of food, had to use the balcony wall.,affordable, wifi is okay. They say free breakfast but its only a bread. So we dont actually avail the 'free breakfast'. Me and my friend shared a bed its comfortable but you have to be mindful that there are people sleeping. Yes this is for those not too picky jetsetter since you'll be sharing a room with others, different nationality and attitude. You have to deposit 10SGD but they will return it to you once you check out, just return to them the towels and the bedding. Btw aircon is OK as well as the rest room, its clean :))",,,,255,24,94

About the room is not tidy and clean after all, so I cannot sleep well in there. But I can find any kinds of food nearby.,Hard to find the frontdoor man, because we arrived too early in the morning. We wanted to check in erlier but we can't, there were still guest in the room, but it's OK. We were allowed to clean our body and changed clothes. The room was so-so. We can hear the next room guest talking. Bathrooms are outside the room and bit small. The location was great close to halal restaurant. You can find nasi kandar restaurant behind the hotel.,Maybe i am unlucky. I got the level 2  ladies dorm. Room no 22. Here's my review  My bed location is secluded. The aircond doesn't reach that area. The air flow from fan also only reach the bed on top of mine so imagine how hot it is even though the ac is there. I am ok if at least can feel the air flow from fan.The curtain to cover is smelly and not clean so i choose to spray it with my perfume to make myself comfortable. 2 of my friend start to feel itchy after few taking a nap.   Toilet/shower? Okaylah even though one of if doesn't have the lock at all. The back door is always open 24hr so that area is not really secure.

Radius International City Lodge,3.0,4 reviews,#276 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Wifi,,"Share, ,free wifi was included,Little India,air conditioner,great air conditioning,air condition system,I was there during 45 days in this country and in this place, because of work. Most of the rooms don't have windows, and are small. You have the Farrer Park Subway next to it. Cons: Depending of the available rooms, you will need to share with other person the room, and sometimes they are leaving and arriving again. Good for meeting people but bad if you end up sharing with a person who is a mess. Pros: You have a paid washing machine, and a television in the ground floor if you really need to check something in television. Summary: it was enough for the price and the hurry of not find nothing else available. Remember that in Singapore almost everything related with accommodation is expensive, and finding a good place is difficult. You can rent with them a month and during that, period look for a better place, or arrange with a friend.  Very bad thing: The hostel is next to a food court, so you can see cockroaches or rats in the ground floor oftenly, in the television place. There is nothing to do about it, but they will never get to your room.,…,Stayed here for three weeks !! Very good hostel, had to share a room but was quite all right, rooms were very clean and room service was two times a week !   They renewed the whole building not so long ago and by the looks of it, was it still renewing ! The only thing that bothered me was the poor and sometimes dirty kitchen.   But there is Wi-Fi over every floor. There is night guard too ! Your Hostel is in the middle of Little India which will be pretty impressive when you go out on a sunday afternoon, you'll see !,写真に騙されて2週間ほど宿泊しました。 安いのはいいのですが、窓がないのと部屋が臭いことを覚悟して泊った方がよろしいかと思います。窓が無いため臭いがこもるので、常にエアコンは切れない状態となり、喉をやられて風邪を引く人が頻発します。ホステルなのでタオルや石鹸、シャンプーなど一切ありません。また、シャワールームとトイレが一緒なのは許せますが、シャワーカーテンがないのでシャワー後には周りが洪水のようになります。シャワーはチょロチョロとしかでなく、突然お湯から水に変わったりもします。ベットはマットレスの上に直接シーツがかかり、背中にスプリングの感触が残ります。また掛け布団はなく、タオルケットが一枚だけでした。これらは、１週間に１度だけ交換してくれます。私の部屋にはTVがありましたが、他の部屋にはないそうです。あと、雨が降ると部屋の中にも雨が降ります。雨漏りの件も含めていくつかリクエストをしましたが、なにも改善していただけませんでした。また、部屋のカードキーを紛失すると50ドル取られるそうです。 日本人の私には理解できない宿泊施設でした。すぐに別のホテルを探しました。,Stayed here for 3 nights over the F1 GP weekend. We couldnt afford our usual hotel as the prices doubled, so went for a hostel instead & this one was fine.  We had a standard private double, with AC & hot water private shower. Room was basic, but had Wifi. No tv (if thats what you want), although teh pictures show a tv - these are for the 'deluxe' rooms which are not available on the hostel websites i used. Room was also on the small side. There is a 7 Eleven type shop next door, & Farrer Park MRT is 2 mins walk away - handy for quick journey to the Quays. Little India (or at least part of it) is a few minutes walk away, & there are also local type eateries very closeby.

Hotel 81 Bugis,3.0,253 reviews,#282 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,It’s along some of the popular 5 star hotels and yet you don’t see much people and traffic.  The nearest MRT Station is about 400 meters away and it’s only 1 to 2 stations from the major landmarks.  Bugis street is just walking distance.  There are also a few local restaurants near here.  If you want a quiet and peaceful place, this is the right hotel for you.  ,This is a love hotel. Hence you wont find much help from the front desk if you are there to travel. The front desk is extremely rude except one guy which you will be able to identify once you stay there. You will find locals with their girlfriends and prostitutes. However the rooms are clean and overall a good place to rest your head.,Hotel location was 5 mins walk away from Bugis Junction. Place was clean, even tho abit small.  Basic necessity like tooth brush and hairdryer is available. Staff at counter is OK and gd price, there is a 7-11 right at the side to satisfy your cravings.,Two things that are expensive in Singapore are a) alcohol and b) accommodation. This is a ""budget"" hotel, yet comparing it to our last room in Kuala Lumpur was night and day. It was about 4 times as expensive and 4 times smaller! We did expect this, but it's an interesting comparison none the less. We found the desk staff to be polite and having pre-booked had no issues with pricing. The room was to accommodate 3 men, 2 shared a double bed and the third on a smaller pull out chair thing. The bathroom is basically a combination of sink, toilet and shower, so make sure you do everything else before using the shower as the room will be soaked afterwards! There were small mites crawling around the shower drain and wall area. There was also a TV and safe (where we stored our, passports, valuables). It was nothing more than a functional room to do your ablutions and sleep. If you're looking for a room with basic purposes and you're going to be out and about a lot, then it's acceptable for the job and is also situated in a great location, which is the main positive for staying here.,…,Hotel 81 is definitely not a place to be when you are on a week-long vacation to Singapore or on a business trip. However, there could be one great reason why you should choose to stay in this hotel. It's in the middle of 2 places I intended to go to when I visited the country. Located at the Middle Rd, it only takes 13 minutes to walk (4 mins if you take a cab) your way to the Merlion Park where you can view the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer across the bay. And the best place to buy souvenirs before going home is just 8 minutes walk to the other side. Bugis Street, or Bugis+ are must-see places where you can buy lots of knick-knacks and other what-nots. Plus, it is surrounded by fast food restaurants where you can buy food even after midnight! The room itself could, be just the same as your room at home. Nothing extra-ordinary and grandiose, but cozy and quiet. And I shouldn't forget... front desk officers are not friendly, if you're looking for a service deluxe treatment. This is something that you should not expect here.,…",Centrally Located,,,714,77,100
Rabbit Carrot Gun,3.0,14 reviews,#205 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,Best macaroni cheese in Singapore, very tasty avocado smash too. The side of broccoli should not have been brown on top, perhaps it was put under a heat lamp or grill to warm it? but that’s a minor issue.  Have visited twice already this month and will definitely return..  The significant negative was the absolutely tiny - 100 ml to be precise - glass of Prosecco.  Rabbit Carrot Gun is not unique in Singapore in not listing the measures of drinks on its menu but I would have happily ordered a bottle had I realised just how small a glass would be. Another niggle, I appreciate it was busy but almost as soon as I’d finished my food, I was approached and told the amount due - there was no “would you like a drink, desert, coffee”...,I’ve been here half a dozen times but never again.  As many others have stated the owner is rude and aggressive which is totally unnecessary.  I am kicking myself for having gone back there again and not immediately walking away.  Best avoided.,Visited on 18 January. Very busy and great atmosphere. Service was excellent, and considering how busy they were, was exemplary.    Three of us had dinner which was out of the kitchen very quickly, and melted in ones mouth. Excellent flavours made the meals ones to remember.   I was the only one who had a dessert, which was the Sticky Date Pudding, and the best I have had in singapore.   The stay of gin was something we had to try, and between the 3 of us, we sampled several great gins.   Highly recommended ,Food wasn’t great , definitely way way way over priced for for food that I would hope never to have again . I would avoid but it’s alllll very meh. Why would anyone pay 27 dollars for a burger that was so not delicious . I wish I didn’t waste the stomach space ,Decent food Lousy service - I don’t seem to understand the reason for being rude bordering on hostile.  They define rules like army sergeants - relax guys! We’re all here to have a good time and you need to match the Sunday demands in a better way. Include politeness and giving the customers a good memorable experience in your menu too.

Well appointed hotel, good pool area and gym.  Excellent breakfast, the happy hour each day at the Waterfall Lounge was much appreciated after a heavy day shopping in the heat.

Fragrance Hotel - Kovan,3.0,9 reviews,#285 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,Location of the hotel is convenient enough. Has a coffeeshop and convenience store just next door. Not far from NEX. Promised Wi-fi is almost non-existent. Receptionist was not very friendly when we checked in. Noisy during the night with doors banging and people talking loudly.,Near to Serangoon NEX shopping mall.. I am abit of a clean freak and since the bed sheet was not spotless, but requested for housekeeping to come and change the bed sheet and the guy was helpful to choose the best bed sheet for my room.,This is an okay basic cheap hotel in the red light district. So it's fine if you are on a budget and not too fussy about the location.   It was clean enough and the staff were helpful.  If you would prefer not to stay here AVOID WOTIF MYSTERY HOTEL DEALS.   I took the risk with a mystery deal that landed me this place, and was charged more than the regular listed price on Wotif's own listing. Wot a ripoff.   After some painful communication with Wotif I was given a partial refund, but they ignored my request to cancel or change to a better hotel.   It's unfortunate that the hotel will be reviewed unfavorably by disappointed guests like me when it's Wotif that should be copping the flack.,Thank god I only stayed here for one night - I had just come back to Singapore from a sidetrip to Burma, and was heading back to the US the following day, and picked this place just as a location to crash for the night before my flight early the next morning. Mercifully this meant I only spent a total of like, 6 hours at this dump.   The place is called the ""fragrance hotel"" and man did they live up to that name - the first room I was given smelled like cigarette smoke even though this property is purportedly non-smoking, and when I complained and was moved to a new room, it smelled sickly sweet like some sort of cheap perfume or something. Whatever, I figured.  The bed felt like it was only a box spring, and was barely comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on. I can't, imagine what it would be like staying here multiple nights. Hallways were absolutely minute and tiny; with the housekeeping cart in the way I could barely get by. Staff was surprisingly decent; the only bright spot in an otherwise awful experience.,…,We had a pleasant stay here in Fragrance Kovan. The room was clean and neatly organised but the room is quite small for us and also there's window in the room. However the reception counter was friendly and helpful. We had a smooth and fast check in by the reception counter Liyana and ZhaoPeng. Their team work was wonderful. We would like to stay here again and if possible rooms with window for us next time? :-D Thanks..",,,,189,8,65

The booking, reception, check in went off without a hitch. The place is located in Chinatown surrounded by skyscrapers. The apartments are housed in a elegant yesteryear building. The rooms consisting of 1 bedroom, living, dining room and kitchenette were spacious, well furnished with all amenities including a washer and dryer in the kitchen. The Wifi was functional and good. Easy walking distance to Chinatown, Mariamman Temple, restaurants, hawker centre. One can take the nearby Singapore MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) and practically cover all places of interest in Singapore. Overall we had an enjoyable stay.  The only downside was inordinate delay in remitting back 250 Singapore dollars taken as, deposit at the time of check in. We were promised the deposit will be refunded in 2 to 3 weeks. The money was finally remitted  after several e mails to the management and the booking agency.

Heritage Collection on Seah,3.0,7 reviews,#212 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian","Share, ,It was a disappointment to book with heritage Collection. They cancel my booking a few days before the date of staycation. It really disrupt my plans. Unreliable hotel to book. I booked a loft room at their cityhall branch yet they wanted to upgrade me to a normal room at Clarke Quay. I don't understand how is that an upgrade? Book at your own risk.,I stayed here for a few days. It is a great location, where it locates at the back of the Raffles Hotel. It takes about five minutes to walk to a shopping mall, which is not as big as Vivo but big enough to see the glory of Singapore.   The room is a loft. It has a bathroom, closet, a small kitchenette, which also has a bench as a desk. There is a queen-size bed on the loft.  It equipped a toaster, water heater, a small pan, and slivers. It also has a microwave oven and a refrigerator.  Hand soap, dish soap, and laundry detergent are provided. For visitors from the US, there is not dishwasher as it is not common in Singapore. The laundry machine is on the third floor.   The check-in and check-out processes were very smooth. A deposit of S$300 is required at the check-in. The, staff worked with me through phone, and Whatsapp is another option. I contacted her twice during my stay, and she responded immediately.   The property does not provide housekeeping, as I stay less than a week. For the toilet kit, they only provide shampoo and shower soap. I got other things from the grocery store located in the nearby shopping mall. It does not provide tea or coffee either. In Singapore, there are many coffee shops. It is just me that I need tea or coffee as the first thing in the morning. I purchased some from the shopping mall.   The bed is not fancy. It is okay. If you are taller than me, 5.5 feet, it is likely you will hit the ceiling. I hit the corner of the roof with my head a few times. Also, be very careful when walking on the stairs. It is quite narrow, and you do need to watch your head to avoid heating the corner. I did enjoy sitting at the stair to view the Raffle hotel.   The property has an Apple TV on the loft. It does not provide local TV programs but internet entertainment, such as Netflix. I do not know how to use the Apple TV remote. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, but I'd never figured out how to input the password of Netflix (provided by the landlord) to watch anything. It does not bother me much, though.  The internet is not stable, and the air conditioner needs some cleaning. The bathroom also needs some upgraded. Between the shower and toilet, there is a light curtain. It is not dirty, but I kept myself away from the curtain. See pictures. The remote control of the air conditioner is not very sensitive.   Overall, it is a good price at such a great location. A few improvements in the cleaning of the air conditioner and bathroom will make it more desirable. I would appreciate a couple of tea or coffee bags and removing trashes every a couple of days. If you will use Grab or taxi, this apartment is located in the ERP area, where the driver has to pay to the government additional fees to drive into this busy area. It means the fees will be higher than the Grab app shows. Note, Grab is like Uber in other countries. I travel about 15 trips a year, and I sometimes like to stay in a B&B or apartment instead of the chained hotels to experience a different setting. I like I was not bothered by anyone during my stay, and I like the decoration and cozy feeling of this apartment.,…,Booked the Premium Loft and the photos certainly did not do it justice, it's way better when you step inside the 'apartment'. Staff were friendly and easily reachable. Location is great with many dining options in the area, as well as, shopping malls and grocery shopping. Love the kitchen that's equipped with a small electric cooker along with knives, cutting board, crockery and cutlery. Perhaps not for MasterChef cooking but we fed ourselves well enough for a hearty breakfast and mini hotpot dinner.   Really enjoyed the cosy environment and would certainly return. However, note to self to bring toothbrush as it's not provided. Satisfied with the bathroom and amenities nonetheless.,Booking.com indicated the room we wanted was available. We called the hotel to ask for directions 2X & were advised in a detailed manner. Upon reaching the entry point, we were refused entry even to the lobby by 2 different staff stating we had to have a reservation to be allowed in. We mentioned we would like to view the room first & would make the decision thereafter. They sent their Property Manager who said that they are fully booked until 9 September.  It was a team of very very poorly trained staff with terrible teamwork & no shared data among themselves. Neither did they practice common sense. A few blatant lies stuck out like sore thumbs.  2 hours after this incident, the room specified was still indicated as available on booking.com.,The first thing I noticed when I entered the apartment was how extremely small it is and that it looked nothing like the photos. There wasn't even space to put our bags so it's actually more recommended for solo travellers as it doesn't even fit couples. The room also had a very damp weird smell, combined by how dark the room is even with all the lights on, makes it feel like you're in a gas station motel. Our TV didn't work, it kept switching on and off but in the few ""good"" times it did, the remotes wouldn't work too.   Our rooms were right next to the laundry area, so we were promised that by 10pm the washer and dryers would be turned off to all guest but for many nights we would wake up to the loud noises of the dryers at the wee hours of 3 and 4 am so we had to turn them, off ourselves causing us a lack of sleep. I believe if you made a promise, you should keep it! I left the apartment at 6am one morning and there was soap all over the floor from the laundry and I almost slipped! I got back at 5pm and almost slipped a second time cause no one has come to attend to the mess. There's no upkeep whatsoever.   The last straw was when my husband nearly fell down the staircase cause the staircase railing came off the cheap glue they used for the railing! The staircase is really very steep. The railing that came off was right at the top of the stairs, if he would've fell, he would've went straight down into the glass doors and it could very have easily been a fatal fall. We then contacted Ray, and as lovely as she is, we knew she was just as dumbfounded and not of much help to situation unfortunately. I have pictures proving all of this and we have yet to receive any apology whatsoever. This apartment ruined our Christmas and they're a massive disappointment. Not to mention, a total life hazard as well.,…",,,,704,73,100
Redwood@Central,4.0,2 reviews,#201 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,free parking,WIFI is free,East Coast Park,AC,Air conditioning,The location is the key here. It is in the heart of the Singapore and at the epicentre of business towers - The suntec towers. The place is magnanimous and quite pleasant. Enjoy your experience as much as they serve with passion and charm.,Stayed here for 36 days straight along with a coworker (both in 1 bedroom units on the street level).  We had wanted a kitchen and washer/dryer since our stay was so long and the price at Redwood was cheaper than the hotel our company wanted us to stay in.  The area is excellent since the Paya Lebar MRT station is just around the corner and you can use that along with Singapore's buses to get anywhere in the country with ease.  Unlike staying in touristy areas  such as Orchard Road surrounded by Americans you actually get to experience the real Singapore when staying at Redwood Central and feel like you are a local.  The area has a lot of activity at night from the restaurant on the corner but it never bothered my sleep and I always felt safe.    The rooms are nice and concrete, on all sides so you do not hear a single sound from neighboring rooms or those above you.  The staff are all friendly and spoke English.  There is a small gym if you want to get a workout in.  Internet worked well and was able to work from the room at night and on the weekends.  Couch was a bit uncomfortable but from seeing my coworkers room each room is furnished different mine had a small fountain in it.  Repairs to the room are done quickly I had the pull handle on the dryer door fall off locking my clothes in and it was fixed the same day.  You have numerous places to eat within about a 5 minute walk.

Hotel 81 Cosy,3.0,73 reviews,#30 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Ok location.. that's it. No breakfast, no room for anything. You don't even get an actual shower. Lots of noice, the AC is directly beating you in the head, the bathroom is a joke and overall poor quality.,We've been there as the pictures looked nice. We stayed for 2nights and won't go back there anymore. We heard from friends living in Singapore, that all Hotels 81 were known for having a lot of prostitutes... We were very disappointed! it was not clean, bad smell, no window, very small room, no hot shower and way to expensive for that kind of place.,Booked this hotel for a one night stopover in Singapore on the way to India, just to get some rest before an early flight in the morning. Given the price, I didn't have the highest expectations, but still - some basic maintenance is definitely needed there if they want to market this as a 'hotel' and expect guests to feel comfortable whilst staying there. In the room the aircon was leaking onto the floor, and a towel had been placed underneath it on the ground. The shower had no curtain so the water went all over the bathroom, the tv channels wouldn't tune properly so we ended up turning it off rather than watch a fuzzy screen, and the bed sheet didnt fit on the mattress so i was basically laying directly on the plasticy mattress all night. The guys at the front desk were, lovely, and helpful. They booked us taxis when we asked, and the free wifi password when asked. I didn't complain or ask to change rooms, because like I said we were there basically to rest and that's it, but overall the hotel needs some attention and general cleaning work done.,…,Ask for the top level room 501. Biggest room, on the roof with views, swing & can smoke on the balcony. So happy we had this room!  They left room open after cleaning it, apparently it’s normal here as there is no crime. They have cc tv so the concierge couldn’t understand why I asked why the room was left open with all our stuff in here. Friendly staff. ,This is a great location if you want to explore the heart of Singapore! Because it is located just behind Chinatown! And next to it there are few bars and pubs for your selection if u want to chill out at night. However, the check-in staff was a little bit rude when he talking to us.

Kim Tian Hotel Han,3.5,2 reviews,#199 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,AC,air condition system,Air conditioning,フロントの対応はどのスタッフもフレンドリーで好感が持てました。 住所的にはゲイランですがKallang駅が最寄りの駅になります。 いずれにしてもゲイランなので子供連れには向かないかもしれません。 タイトルにあるように大通りに面しているため騒音は多少気になりますが、ベイサンズやフライヤーも見れて眺めは良いと思います。 お部屋はこの価格にしては天井も高くコスパはそこそこですが、朝方とにかく外でタバコを吸っているのか部屋にその煙が入り込んでやや不快でした。 すぐそばには店がないですが、１００ｍくらいで飲食店、２００ｍくらいでコンビニもあります。 一応２４時間対応のフロントにも飲み物を販売しているのでそちらで購入も可能です。,We used the efficient MRT from Changi airport to Kallang Station (EW10) & paid just S$1.59 using a prepaid EZ-Link MRT card we ordered from a website that promotes the airport for S$9 & got it upon arrival.  It’s better to arrive in SG late at night or early morning to avoid the notorious heat & humidity.    It’s like walking inside a toaster-oven during the day, so keep hydrated and bring a small towel to wipe the you dry from all the perspiring.  The hotel is about a kilometer walk from the Kallang MRT Station but if you’re dragging a big luggage while sweating & huffing, it’s quite a feat.  Singapore is near the equator so walking around is no fun.    Along the way, you'll see some food stalls but a few of them open late.  I noticed one that was extremely popular among, drivers that serves Malay-Indian dishes.  The area is in a quiet road but right across a main thoroughfare on whose side trees and other greeneries were planted to buffer from the dust and fumes.   The hotel is housed in a recessed, nondescript building with glass door entrance.   Check-in was prompt & manned all the time as it seems the place also serves as a love hotel.    The elevator, although small, is quite fast.  It can accommodate maybe 3 people with big suitcases.   The room is small - about 8 x 10, with a high 12-foot ceiling. but as we were assigned an 8th-floor room that fronts the street, there’s great view of the Singapore skyline from the window.    So expect to sort your stuff on top of the bed if you have a big luggage as there’s limited room to wiggle around.  The bathroom is about 4.5 square feet. You shower on the same area where the toilet bowl & sink are – so a flipflops helps. The shower pressure is great & hot water flow is great -- if you’re afraid of taking cold showers – which is ideal- in very hot & humid Singapore.    Towels -very thin- & toothbrushes were provided but there were no other toiletries. The sheets are clean but another set of pillows would help travelers get better rest.  The overhead A/C is operated by a remote control & takes a bit of fiddling to get to one's choice of temperature --specially if you're in the room at mid-day.  The ad says “smoke-free guestrooms” but we smelled hints of tar or nicotine in our room.  The hotel is so close to Geylang Road which is dotted with cheap shops & eating places and known as the ‘red light district’ of Singapore. So before you head back to your room, get your food, snacks & drinks from these shops & save a lot.  They open early, too!  Even at most cheap eating places, you may find the price of beer expensive (about S$8 for a liter) but at 'hawker food centers', it's OK to bring your beer bought from some place else.  The bus stop in front of the hotel doesn’t service the places of interests so just use the Kallang MRT as your base or take the buses along Geylang Road (the closest one fronts the Mohd Salleh Mosque) to avoid walking long distances in this very humid place.    As a final tip, take bus #100 and got off near Golden Mile Food Center -about 10 minutes from Geylang Road- and enjoy some of the best  'hawker food' Singapore has to offer!,…",,,,155,26,78

Budget Room Hotel,1.5,9 reviews,#57 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Wifi,,"Share, ,We are so so disaapointed, the room is dirty, smells bad, the bedsheet, blackets, and pillow cover are not good... there are BED BUGS so you cannot sleep well... Please dont stay in this hotel its very disaapointing!!,I would ask you for the sake of 30-50 USD/40-60 EUR/35-65AUD/20-30GBP to stay somewhere else.  I was asked to email the establishment to confirm at least 24 hours before arrival in Singapore that I was still taking a room. I got a reply from the owner/manager to confirm that I should ring a number upon landing advising of on arrival details and provide a photocopy of my passport. I was cut off twice by a woman who could not speak English and asked to ring back - all this when I am trying to collect my bags - all on a non Singapore mobile.  I arrived at the 'hotel' which looks like converted office accommodation with plasterboard walls to wait for 10 minutes for the same non English speaking girl who appeared vacant, confused and only knew ""Pay now you pay now"" - INSPITE of the, Asia Rooms advertised rate there was an attempt to inflate this - perhaps the girl only knew the English for $150 rather than $100.  I was shown to a room that had no windows. The room was small - air conditioned and with fan - complete with Save the Environment posters - OR PAY for leaving the air conditioning on.  The shower and toilets were communal however not separate - hence like a lot of establishments in Asia - splash everywhere. They were filthy and disgusting - broken tiles, hair and smelly. I bought a bottle of disinfectant.  When I returned the next day to change an English speaking woman advised me the 'girl' had given me the wrong room - a double instead of a single. I was moved to another room - not an upgrade more a sidegrade at least this came with windows - nevertheless it took some time to work out the fan and I am the most technophile.  The only advantage to this fleapit is the location - other than that avoid the place at all costs. I think it is a health concern and I am contacting the authorities in Singapore about this and other issues.  Take it from me, as someone who has been to Singapore more than 50 times, I do not expect 6 star facilities for less than $60 per night but I expect cleanliness.  DO not stay here - not suitable for children, the elderly or pets,…,I am actually writing this review from said room, unable to sleep through mortal fear of catching botulism from the bed linen.  This place is truly a cess pit. The lobby/reception is pleasant enough but each and every room feels like an economy room at the Bangkok Hilton if you know what I mean.  Dilapidated, tired, hazardous to health, dirty, dank and smelling of damp. At the end of a 3 month tour of Asia covering Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos this is genuinely the worst accommodation I have stayed in.  Pictures to follow for those of a strong enough constitution.,I had done a lot of searching on the web to find a cheap and proper place to stay in Singapore during the last weekend.  It's really hard.  I finally chose this so called hotel @ SGD85 just because of its strategic location in Orchard area.  Except its good location, everything is so bad and I highly recommend NOT to go:  1.  I booked a single room with attached shower and toilet.  After confirmation, I was told the attached shower and toilet is actually shared with a room next to my room.  That's tricky.  So I bargained the price from SGD85 to SGD75;  2.  The place is difficult to find.  There's no sign, no name plate at all.  No one ever mention it's on 3rd floor.  It's not a hotel at all.  3.  Once I entered into the room, I got the musty smell, it's like the room had been, kept closed for long time.  The air-con unit which was dusty was fixed at the ceiling at the room centre.  The room was not well ventilated and I slept with such a nasty smell through the night.  I asked to move to another room the next day;  4.  I didn't get bed bugs and itchy like the previous reviewer ( I wore long sleeves with collar when sleeping).  But if so told, I was not surprised at all.  I simply felt things were not clean there.  Bed sheets, furnitures, TV, fan were old;  5.  No provisions:  only a half roll of toilet paper was provided for my 2 nights' stay (remember I shared the toilet with another room); no cup for brushing teeth and so I have to use the primitive method: use my palms to bowl water into my mouth;  only a thin blanket;  6.  Like the previous reviewer, I found no hot water for bathing.  The next day after taking shower in cold water, I rushed to buy Vitamin C tablets.  Upon enquiry later, the host lady told me that there's actually a switch outside the toilet room that made hot water available (oh.. why didn't tell in the first place!).    It's my first time to Singapore after noticing the cut-throat price of air-ticket.  It's short of 2 days and I don't want to spend much in Singapore.  Though this place is the cheapest I have found on web ( I don't want to stay in those in red light zone), I don't think it worths, I think it only worths no more than SGD40.  Don't think of going.,…,""PLEASE pay $50 -$80 extra and get yourself a half decent place to stay. i) they agreed to a set price and tried to charge me extra at the last minute (get everything in writing). ii) there were itchy bed bugs in the room - could not get any sleep all night. iii) there were no blankets and the pillow stank like dog iv) when I looked for someone to ask for a blanket no-one was anywhere to be found. IT WAS LIKE THEY ALL MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED after 10pm. v) the towels they gave us looked like they came out of a blender vi) there was no hot water - cold shower only vii) the worst experience in a budget room in my life viii) yes, it is close to the major shopping street (the only conceivable positive.)

Not helpful staff.  Pictures on they website are not real.  Very bed experience. Please don't book this hotel!!!!!!!,This accommodation is not for the faint hearted, or those who are likely to feel sick at the sight of a mouldy bathroom, damaged floor tiles and a bath with grime and peeling ceiling paint throughout etc.  The pictures on the hotel website are in no way a reflection of it's current state of disrepair and neglect and issues with cleanliness and security in regard to broken window locks, makes for an uneasy rest, particularly at night.  The double bed is too close to the main door, making it difficult to get in and out either with or without luggage.   The hotel has a rickety old lift that shudders as if it is near on breaking down.  An electric kettle, three complimentary bottles of water are all that comes with the room, a part from linen, towels and disposable toiletries. Not, coffee or tea is provided. The room was also not serviced by cleaners or towels replaced during my three days stay.  While there is a TV and an airconditioner, however, no mini fridge is provided, so be prepared to go down to the carpark area and pay for a cold soft drink from a vending machine. The other machine has a variety of 2 minute noodles.   The reception is open 24/7 with frequent staff changeover so some friendly and a few not so much.  I was not aware at the time of the booking that the K hotel 12 is situated on the edge of what is locally known as 'Sin City' or redlight district, Geylang, of Singapore.  In the evenings, after 9pm, the streets in Geylang become noisey from cars honking, people loitering and talking loudly most of the night, you can overhear bargaining and dealing with minders outside the illegal and legal brothels, so if you're a very light sleeper, my advice is to have earplugs with you during your stay.  There is a small mini-mart nearby and cafe's for provisions and quick dining, but I would try and get what you need before evening, to avoid brothel minders in the streets trying to get business from you and to meet the ladies inside the homes and hotels. There are many rent by the hour hotels and every even numbered street has a string of brothels in them.  In my opinion, I would only recommend this hotel for the budget conscious traveller, if you are single or travelling with other singles, but not suitable for families with children.  Despite it's sleazy reputation, Geylang has some great eateries and street food and relatively close to the Suntec City Convention Centre. Yellow and Blue taxi costs ($8 - $15) was minimal to and from the city areas (7-10 minutes drive) and MRT is about 600-800 mtrs from the hotel.,…",,,,56,6,76

After our arrival to the hotel and paying for our entire four days of stay, we were given keys to the room. Just after entering we have found our a plenty of cockroaches walking all over the walls, which have spreaded all over the room after we switched on the light. We have notified the hotel's reception and the only thing they offered instead was another room, which was also cockroach infested (we have also found a dead cockroach on the corridor). After more than 12 hours of travel we had to immediately look for another hotel, where we could at least sleep without insects. The K 14 hotel's staff, however, denied any responsibility and refused to give us, back any money we have previously paid for the entire stay, despite we have not even spent an hour at this place. On top of that, they also tried to charge us with additional cancellation costs. That way, they have robbed us of siginificant amount of money. Avoid them at all cost!,…,The room is literally all bed and thus the TV and all is at an angle to the bed. Also, you can tell the hotel has many spots like the ceiling of the toilet and under the basin that looks like it was patched up and not professionally fixed.

Some noisy Construction work currently being carried out at the rear of the hotel during daytime whilst they build a new condominium behind.  Fortunately, this hotel has a lift.,I wasn't expecting much for the 45 sgd I paid. What I was hoping for was a clean room and somewhere to get my head down for the night. When I arrived the receptionist was rather abrupt and allocated me my room.  As soon as I looked around the room I was back at reception demanding the bedding be replaced as it was badly stained. The bedding was replaced promptly and I got my head down. I was woken numerous times with the noise, of receptionist coughing, his phone going and comings and goings, ear plugs would have been advantageous. The worst thing was when I woke in the morning,  I was covered in bites, I can only assume were due to bed bugs as no evidence of mosquitoes.

They provide clothes washing but they come back smelling like food.   A lot of mold is found troughout the hostel. The owner is to strickt and not concidered at all.  You are better of finden another hostel for this price.,Don't waste your money there. I was in that campus for several month and it is the worst. Dirty, small and expensive. It is near botanic gardens, it's the only good point.  Near the fridge sometimes I have found rats. The rooms are so small and so expensive.

City Backpackers Clarke Quay,3.0,104 reviews,#254 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Hindi","Share, ,Im sorry for saying that. But if u r patient to listen to me, u will know why. I came to Sing from Malaysia in 16th July and i booked 1 room for 1 night in this hotel. When i arrived, they said the ac in the room was not working, we said: ok, fine. We can stay in fan room. But they said, the fan was also not prepared and they sent us to another hotel called"" yes, china town"" which was so dirty. No wifi, no water and very dirty. We just booked 1 night in 16th so after staying,17th at noon we took a ferry to Batam island, Indonesia. Now when i came home, my bank called me and said that the city backpacker hotel wanted to charge me for 1 more night cause my bank account doesnt have enough money. Funny?? I have all papers to prove that i only booked 1 night and stayed only 1 night, in Singapore in 16th. I have stamps in my passport from immigration control to prove i was in Sing only in 16th too. One more thing, if ur guest stayed 2 nights but only paid 1 night, if you were the receptionist, would you let us leave the hotel if you cant charge money from my debit card or cash? Now i come home but have to solve the problem from Sing. I will make it clear because i want to prove that im not cheater, they are. I have all papers because i have a hobby: i collect all transfer tickets, all receipts,all hotel booking ... Where i traveled. Please!if you see this message, try to help me to solve our problem, because i tried to leave a question to your hotel but it didnt work.always "" Try tomorrow"" . Strange! Thank you! ,…,Try to make it short again:  -Nice people at front desk (don't know their ways around well, but Google maps helps) -it's clean (I know singapore standards are pretty high, for that it was only ok) -the rooms are big enough for luggage etc. -every bunk has two power sides, so one for each person -locker with room key  -aircon -computer for free use -problems with wifi all the time (even on the computer) but if u tell them they try to fix it directly  -breakfast included (bread and spread, be early for good stuff) -kitchen is small, a long room one side a table with microw , kettle and plates (no stoves) all clean and 4 chairs.  Small table with chairs outside (I don't think u can cook much there) -laundry service  (5sd for washing,  5sd for drying ) -close to Chinatown and the, train station ---easy to go from the airport and only 2.50sd so really cheap but u need small money in Singapore dollar to get a ticket ( be prepared ) -only two shower and two toilets on the 3rd floor 4 rooms each floor I think so it could get busy (but even Chinese new year was not so busy that we couldn't take a shower) -good showers, strong a lot water! -clothe r gettin wet sometimes when u shower  I hope it's not to mixed up... ,…,Just went back from Singapore, I stay here for 1 night. My experience with this hotel was good. There is 7-11 beside it and it is near Clarke Quay. I took 1 bed in 6 bed mix dorm. So far everything was okay, except for the security part. I slept around 11pm then woke up in 2 am morning because I was so shocked when I opened my eyes, there was a guy (I don't think he is singaporean, look like middle-east people) sneaking in my room. He was standing & looking at the window, just like he was observing something. Trust me guys, this guy was really suspicious. Whenever I made a small move, he will stop looking at the window, then after a few minutes, he will do it again & again. At first, I thought this guy was my room mate, but after I wait (pretend to sleep) for about 1 hour, all, my room mate coming in, and this guy just standing in front of the locker within my room. Then he went outside and never came back. My advice and suggestion is, take care of your belonging whenever you stay in this hotel especially when you stay alone or share your rooms with others. I might think twice if I wanna come to this hotel again in the future.,…,I read all the reviews here and thinking about bed bugs, I thought it was handled by the hostel and surely the bed bugs are still everywhere. We stayed in the bunk bed room with 8 beds on the 2nd floor.  Oh hell, we booked 2 nights here and I could not sleep the entire first night because of the bed bugs. 10 pm tried to lay down on the bed and got bit by bed bug then I killed it, a few minutes later I saw another one crawling over the curtain and I killed again. Could not sleep for the entire night, I needed to back and forth sitting on the couch at the receptionist area. Since the receptionist had already gone by 10 pm, I was alone contemplating myself and tried to get back to bed 1-2 am if I recall.  And it still didnt work out, bed bugs everywhere, and got bit again on my, arms, my thigh, my neck, and even my thumb. I mean like thats it. I would not be sleeping!  Stayed again at the receptionist area surfing browsing my mobile phone reading all the reviews here while browsing for some nearest affordable hostel/hotel thinking to moving out for the next days.  Thank God the wi-fi worked really fast so it's a perfect time to kill my time til the next morning.  The morning came at 5-6 am and I decided to breathe some fresh air outside by walking, got back and told my friend about what happened last night. My friend managed to sleep even though he shocked by the bit marks by the bed bugs all over the body so yes we decided to move out for the 2nd day. Avoid this place at all cost.  Breakfast was nice for hostel, just bread and a couple of jams. Bathroom and toilet a lil bit dirty. Laundry area and sink were pretty clean we can accept that.  So til 11 am we decided to early check out and told the receptionist we moving to the friend's apartment (too tired for us to argue since I read the reviews from the same cause complained to them and got transfered to another bed/another room and as resulted the same which was still bitten by the bed bugs)  Oh well, at least the receptionist were nice to us.  Oh yeah no elevator/lift, all stairs and you all need to put off your shoes on the stairs with the unlocked doors who happens giving me paranoia about some strangers stealing our shoes from outside.,…,I know this hostel sound cheap but there living many bugs (tungau/kutu). Your sleep will never be same again. No receptionist (if you late check in), owner of thus hostel not so friendly.

Queen Resident,2.0,12 reviews,#53 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,We recently booked a stop over stay at Queen Resident over the internet. Looking at the website, the double room showed what appeared to be reasonable looking room. When we arrived, there were a bunch of guys slurping soup near the counter. We proceed to pay by credit card and were told what floor our room was on. When we got to the room we opened the door, took one look, and we both looked at each other and said ""there is no way we are staying here!"". The bed had only a bottom sheet on it which had stains on it, the pillows looked as though they were about 10 years old, crumpled, flat dirty looking and the walls were all scuffed and grubby. The room you could hardly swing a cat. The rest of the corridors looked dark and dingy with other rooms with Asian men laying on mattresses, on the floor. This place is just a filthy unkept pig sty.  We proceeded down the stairs and told them we have changed our mind and could we get our money back. The owner said ""once you pay there are no refunds"" (mmm, I think that must be the only way they make any money!). We managed to get 3/4's of our money back and left. We give this place a rating of Zero, and if you are looking for a sauna, Club One Seven is far far cleaner.,…,Negative  1. The room is too small. 2. Too many money boys! All of them are already illegal for overstaying 3. Very dirty, messy! 4. I saw a man ""indian"" cleaning the balcony at the 2nd floor, automatically the dirty water will go to jacuzzi at the 1st floor. 5. At Sauna, the crowd are ugly, oldies and yuckie! 6. At the bathroom a.) Toilet is very dirty b.) No Tissue or either soap c.) They just use hose instead of bidet, the hose is very dirty and not useful because it has a hole that the water will go to your face!! 7. 1st floor for reception is very dirty, you can see a dog ""Dalmatian"" always going around at the 1st floor and barking and stink! 8. All floors from 1st to 5th floor are very messy, some of them stink and need a total renovation!  If you already came to BABYLON, ""Gay Hotel"" at Bangkok it's a totally different!! DONT EVERY COME HERE! This is not a gay friend hotel!  Positive  1. Cheap Price 2. Near Chinatown and Outram Park Station 3.

Gallop Kranji Farm Resort,2.5,21 reviews,#250 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,We were staying for two nights here hoping for a nice countryside experience. The place is totally deserted. All the restaurants and pbars are closed except one malay stall (not a restaurant) with very limited options. Breakfast includes one very tasty potato thingy, one fried egg and 3 toasts with a little bit of kaya. If you are not a fan of bread, you would still be hungry. We didnt bring water with us, and there was no possibility to buy a bottle of water anywhere (malay stall only has canned drinks) so we had to go back to the mrt station to get it there. One very annoying thing is the reception. It is never opened. We had to wait for 30 minutes under the rain to check in and we never saw it open in 2 days. So if you really have any kind of issue or a question, there is no, one to help you. The activities around the resort are also limited:most of the farms are closed, we went for lunch to Bollywood Veggies, it was okay. The resort is really worn out, everything is quite old, the bathtub with jacuzzi was really nice but there was almost no hot water so we had to fill it with a boiling water from the kettle. We didnt manage to make the steamroom work abd there was no one to ask. The barbeque pit costs 30 dollars and it was really nice, thankfully we brought a lot of food otherwise we would have been very hungry all the time. Overall, for 620 dollars for 2 nights it is a joke!,…,We booked accommodation for 8 pax via Agoda in Gallop Kranji Farm Resort  Upon reaching I was told no rooms available, and asked me to contact Agoda and the worst answer given to us is "" it’s not their problem ""… disaster didn’t end… asked for parking lot and received a reply saying that no parking lots available for guests, and front desk staff said the boss of the resort also pay and park there. Asking myself what kind of resort facility is this?   Finally I was given 4 separate rooms with no BBQ & kitchen facility… I thought that’s the end, but next day again I was shocked by another answer, when I asked for breakfast, they said “ Sir tomorrow is public holiday so today no breakfast “ and my booking with Agoda is “Free Breakfast” what the hack.  Not even worth for single, star, didn’t expect this kind of service standard in Singapore hotels/resorts   Moreover early in the morning I called the resort and asked them to check whether they received the booking, until noon time there is no response from them.,…,2 stars Becos it’s really not a bad place  The bed was very sandy, don’t know where the sand came from probably the housekeeping didn’t really do a good job, my room balcony door was damage cannot lock. Sofa bed have stain.   I went to a so call massage place and went for a 20$ massage end up they put me in a tub of water with a machine to massage my feet and the whole place just looks like it’s just open or closing down, and the person say they have open for 3 months  Worse is I’m walking around the food stores and the street a lot of people are not wearing mask,We stayed one night at this place. I can imagine that this place once had been really great, but I must admit, it is a bit of faded glory for the moment. We cycled through that area, and if you looking for a place to sleep, it is one of the only places (maybe the only one?) where you can sleep. We stayed in one of the villas, which are ok if it is only for one night sleep. The main room has a bed, and then you have the bathroom, so there is not a lot of pace. The shower in the bathroom was outside, which was kinda cool :) Outside we had a small terrace with a table and two chairs, but inside there is no place to sit (apart from the bed). There was no shampoo/shower gel upon arriving, but when we asked the staff, they were really friendly and provided us with some. So overall the, room is clean and ok to sleep, just a bit small.  The resort itself is really big, with a lot food corners, however, there was only one food stand open till 6:30pm. To have dinner by 6:30pm, it really is not convenient, and it was only Malay food. We decided to go back to Kranji to have dinner in a bistro (but there was no cab that wanted to come pick us up in that area, so we took our bicycles to go back..). As for the breakfast in the morning, it was included in our room price, and we were given a voucher to chose between American breakfast or local.. We didn't had a choice, as there was only one food stand open, and so we had Malay breakfast..   I understand they might have just reopened for staycations again, but I'm afraid they will need to improve their services, as on site dining till 6:30pm only and only 1 choice of breakfast, is not the way to attract people. Not if you're in the middle of nowhere ;-)   When we wanted to check-out, there was no one there (but we couldn't just leave as they ask 100 SGD upon arrival as guarantee). We called them and someone showed up 10 minutes later, but a bit annoying if they state the reception is open all day, and when checking-out at 9:40am no one is there...,…,Book two rooms for a night for 26/01/2019 for my family for my husband birthday celebration. First we are received by a very rude Indian lady by the name Ms. Kana (she give her name). As we are 15+-minutes early, her first sentence to us is, “ book in time is 3” in a very angry tone. Is this the type of tone for a front desk customer service? By the way she is the only person at the front desk. No problem, we go around the surrounding. The view we see are locked, rundown and abandoned farms. The only activities is the pawing, bottle feeding the fishes. By three we went back to the front desk again. For two rooms, we are given one gate door tag. One key for each room. When we ask for wifi password and complimentary parking. Very rudely she reply no wifi and no complimentary, parking. We mentioned that at Agoda website there is wifi. And parking for guest are free in the hotels. She replied Agoda is not our websites. We are shock with this reply. If you had allowed Agoda to post your resort how can you reply this remarks. My sons were so upset and disappointed. Next we ask for a BBQ PIT. To rent a BBQ pit cost S$50 and given a used wire mesh without charcoal. Next come another shocking sight. The rooms were surrounded with a lots of ants. When we go into the room it’s was very very small. The spare between the bunk bed and the wardrobe is not even a length of one litres water bottle. How to open th door? Fridge is beside the wardrobe along the bunk bed, same issue, cannot open the fridge door. No table for your BBQ foods. We carried a garden bench from the abandon guard house two doors away to placed our cooked food. We started to BBQ our food at 5pm. By 6:30pm we pass the bench to our neighbour as they also face the same problem. My sons after having the foods wanted to go home. So e let them go home as e re very vey disappointed. Next day when we check out we had  another shocking event. I give my deposit receipt for the S$100 refund. She refund me the money without asking for the room keys. I forget too. When we are in our car, then I realised that I still have the keys with me. We decide that is not right not to return the keys. We turn back to return the keys. Next we are asked to carry back the bench to its original location. What the hell is this. We could have just take home the keys instead of making the effort to turn back. Very very horrible and bad experience. With the price of S$320 for who rooms we can have a better facilities, better service at other place.,…",,,,,,

Staff was rude and service was really bad.,Im Rahmen einer Dienstreise nach Singapur und meinem Wunsch nach Strandnähe, buchte mich die Firma, im Island Resort ein. Nur mit einem Zaun vom East Coast Park getrennt, eigentlich eine nette Lokation. Zimmer sind einfach aber sauber. Das angebotene ""Free Wifi"" entpuppte sich, als sehr launenhaft, da es nicht vom Hotel gestellt wurde, sondern zu ""wireless@sg"" gehört und im Zimmer permanenten Schwankungen unterlag. Fernsehprogramm war nicht berrauschend und wurde von mir so gut wie nicht genutzt. Wichtig bei der Reservierung in diesem Hotel ist, das man die ""Quiet"" Seite wählt, da die andere Seite des Hotels als ""Party Zone"" gilt und auch sehr intensiv und laut dafür genutzt wird. Mit der Klimaanlage konnte ich mich auch nicht anfreunden, da sie so plaziert ist, das sie genau,, auf den Körper bläst. Das angebotene im Preis beinhaltete Früstück entpuppte sich als wiederkehrende Abfolge der selben Gerichte. Englisch und Indisch wird angeboten. Das Hotel wird von Indern geführt und auch von grossen Reisegruppen Indischer Touristen frequentiert, was man beim Frühstück nur als ""Clash of the Culturs"" bezeichnen kann. Erstens sollte man kurz vor 7:30 Uhr da sein, da es sonst sehr voll wird und schon mal länger am Buffet dauern kann. Als zweites Beispiel wäre zu erwähnen, das bei Rückkehr an meinen Tisch ein Inder noch Platz genommen hatte, dessen Manieren für uns als total intolerabel zu bezeichnen sind. Rotzen und Spuclen beim Frühstück verleideten mir den Appetit und wurden erst nach Beschwerde beim Manager abgestellt. Personal wie überall in Singapur freundlich und bemüht. Da ich Mietwagen hatte wurden keine öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel benutzt. Habe allerdings von einem Australischem Pärchen erfahren, das sie Samstags ca.eine Stunde auf Ihr Taxi warten mussten. Ansonsten besteht die Möglichkeit mit dem Bus zur Bedok MRT Station zu fahren. Fazit sehr gemischt. Privat würde ich es nicht buchen, trotz der tollen Location und der Aussicht.,…",,,,24,5,53

Hotel Supreme,3.0,426 reviews,#309 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,It was unfortunate that I had to book a hotel room because my flat was undergoing home improvement programme. And another great misadventure to book Hotel Supreme thinking that a retro 1970s looking hotel will be an experience.  I chose a non-smoking room. I am super sensitive and allergic to cigarette smoke. I checked into the hotel on 6/7/2021 pretty late at night. I was greeted by two elderly mature senior receptionists. I tried to be friendly and explained the reason I was there. One of them J cut me short..  The next day, around 5:42am, I was awoken by cigarette smell emitted out from the aircon vent. I dismissed it and continued with my sleep. When I went to the bathroom, there was smoke smell again in the bathroom. I felt puzzled but   I tolerated it.   Then, the whole of, 8/7/2021, I was annoyed by cigarette smell the entire day. I could not work/study from the hotel room properly. I called the reception many times to ask him to do something about the smoke and that angered the stuff. They were all mad at me.  9/7/2021, in the morning, I went down in the morning to make a complaint and they just brushed me off; all they did was just to make a phone call to a ""room"" asking them not to smoke.  Now is 11:42pm. I called the receptionist again and he scolded me, ""This is a budget hotel and all our guests like YOUR room very much!""   My point is, 'how could you let guests get away with smoking and pounding chilli using the mortar and pestle in the hotel room! And there is no smoke detector in the rooms!'  I have bad hives and am unwell and on the 8/7 and videocalled a doctor.   Now I still have to stay here till 17/7/2021 as I have already paid for my stay!  I am so upset because they seem to deny the fact that there is really cigarette smell and just because it is a ""budget hotel"" does not mean you can have such rude service towards ""poor"" people who choose to stay with you. We deserve to breathe CLEAN AIR!!!,…,great staff service great from the bar staff especially from bar staff ozgur,aytug first on arrival put in a room that was basically falling apart but after quick word to reception we were changed room and it was great from ther out only thing that daults this place really is lack of english speaking staff.,Albert and John were very kind and friendly They helped us so much Very clean Very close to everywhere We walked to everywhere to the botanic garden and orchard road from the hotel The rooms are very good,the location of this hotel is not at all near orchard road. Its quite a distance from orchard road.  At night there are suspicious characters by the side of the corridor.  Did not feel secure eventhough theres a police presence during the day.,This hotel is well located considering the price however the facilities are pretty dated and in average condition.  What's particularly disappointing is the attitude of some of the desk staff, arrogant and belligerent sum it up best.  As a last choice I may stay there but realistically the poor attitude of the staff outweigh the cheap pricing.","Mid-range,Centrally Located",,,391,57,100
Fragrance Hotel - Ocean View,3.0,28 reviews,#275 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,This hotel is convenient if you are attending to some events in NUS or the western part of Singapore.  A pretty small hotel but adequate based on the price paid. Not recommended for families as they cater to short time booking of the rooms as well; by the hour rates. So I guess many couples visit this hotel for a “happy” time.   Many food joints just round the corner and operates 24 hrs. Thus this is a plus point, just a 3 min walk. 7-11 is also close by.,Staff at the reception, Syazwan Shahrom and Syahidah, left a good impression on us. They were patient, cheerful, and calm handling our enquiry and requests, even on a busy day where other customers awaited their turn. We want to say ""Thank You"", and wish them well in their career in the hospitality industry.,Would love to say 2 of the staff at oceanview by the name of salamat and faizal or faisal was extra nice and caring. They gave us directions to places and we wanted to go via buses and the train. Because we were on a tight budget travel. And we didnt want to cab everywhere. They even shared stories of singapore and even told us where to get cheap food or even the nearest shopping center to go shopping and all. Would definitely come back to oceanview because of this 2 guys really cool people. Good job frangrance you need more people like them.,Very inexpensive hotel.  I found the reason when I got into the room: No closet, no clothes hanger, no fridge, no hand towel, shower head on the toilet wall, thin wall, crying girls in the evening :-(. But, silent after midnight, and convenience store (7d/w, 24h/d) and delicious restaurants are just beyond the corner :-).,The twin sharing room (Rm 407) has no windows. The previous room assigned (501) has a windiw but was next to the generator/engine room. The light between the beds were out-of-order and maintenance took 5 days to replace the bulb and that was after I informed the reception 3 times.  The toilet seat does not fit the seat. Generally, Reception and Housekeeping staff are courteous,  friendly and helpful with the exception of a Malay lady who was on duty at the Reception on the morning of Sat 11 June, she behaves and looks like she is attending a wake.   Two items in excellent working condition are the shower head and aircon.",,9454,ZenHotels.com,26,4,51
Aliwal Park Hotel,3.0,70 reviews,#304 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,We booked the hotel around January, and tried to cancel and get a refund as early as the first week of February. But they rejected it! We also ask if we can alter the dates but they also insist. WE ARE ALL IN CRISIS. And this kind of service? Is below a 1 star!! At least give some compassion to your guests! No wonder your hotel looks like a trash! We all didn’t expect all of these and yet you can’t even give us a choice? How heartless can you be? For money????🤔 Well I hope our money was helpful! This is just unbelievable!!!! Don’t ever go to this crap bldg!!! Poor service!!! Disgusting!!! ,The best thing about this place is the price. Its in a good location, its cheap, and you get a room to yourself with a bathroom. I thought i was getting a window, like the picture of the room type I selected, but I got a dark little concrete box. But hey, its quiet and private so fine. I had a shower and went to get into bed, only to discover the bed has no top sheet. Just a ragged old blanket. I called down for a sheet and had to go down to get it myself. Don't think they have many staff here or any who care. If you need to be  on a budget, this place is totally fine.,We make a booking at this property for one room 8-10 February 2020. Unfortunately we cant make it there as our tour operator cancel the trip to Singapore due to the corona virus incident.   I ask for a refund though it stated no refund but hey, its an outbreak and people are scared. At least return a night booking payment would be considerable.   They even didn't refund the city tax even the Singapore gov exclude all hotels from paying it due to this incident.   They are unethical and unprofessional. I highly recommend that if you are planning to stay here. DONT!,My partner and I arrived at different times, he checked in (even though the booking was in my name) and I came later that evening. They let me up and I slept. No problems the next day/night but on the morning of the 3rd I left all of my stuff in the room and we made a run to hand my passport into the embassy for a visa (Indonesia). When we got back to the hotel I was refused entry because I hadn't signed in? The same woman at the desk who let us out in the morning asked for my passport. When I explained it was at the embassy she refused further help. I offered my drivers license, a picture of the passport, even to email it but she kept saying no. I even had the booking confirmation email. I told her I couldn't collect my passport until 8pm and she said ""then you can't come in, until then"". All of my stuff was in the room, my partner was allowed up to get some of it but we had planned to shower, get changed and decide where to go for the day as we had no plans till later in the evening. The woman was very unforgiving and unhelpful, offering no alternatives or leway despite us being 3 days into our stay and having seen me multiple times already. We had already had issue with cockroaches in the room and with it being such a tiny space (exact same size as a single room). Overall really upset and disappointed. Would not come again.,…,i am a a doctor who visited your hotel on august 2019,had the terrible experience with the front desk lady,who rudely talk to me and my wife in front of the other foreigners, and never experience such a terrible thing in our county as well as anywhere at your country as well,we plan our tour to Singapore with great difficulty with my wife by finding the time and vacation with our very busy working schedule,if you don't know the hospitality visit sri lankan hotel and take the experince and learn from them.the lady on front  damage the image of the Singapore country.....",,,,408,71,100
Changi Beach Club,2.5,4 reviews,#45 of 95 B&Bs / Inns in Singapore,,,"Share, ,free Wifi,Changi airport,free parking,Changi Airport,comfortable with free wifi,East Coast Park,free parking,No toiletries, full of ants all over the room with no room slippers provided, rusty safety pin found on the floor, hot water from rain shower that does not come until the next morning, Shower head does not work.. Do I need to go on? ,Stayed at the beach club 14th Nov and would never go back. Not usually one to complain but i have NEVER stayed at a worse place, as soon as we walked in the room stunk of mould, which reflected on the mould all in the bathroom. No toiletries in the room, unfriendly staff (didn't smile), if you are in a wheelchair or have young kids and a pram don't stay as there is no lift, stairs and no help to get to the room. And if you want to stay close to the airport at get rest don't bother as cleaning machines outside start at 7.15am. Ants all in the room even on the bed... Hair all in the drain of the shower and the mirror was not even clean. So much noise around to. Just been in Vietnam for 2 weeks and the 2 star hotel had better service. Not worth the 158SGD we paid and so glad it was, only one night. Don't recommend staying here, there are far better places in Changi.,…,What a cool spot! Close to the airport, and cheap. The rooms were spacious and the beds comfortable. There is a massive pool and well as a little pool with a slide going into it that the kids just loved. The restaurant onsite had delicious food and if you wanted some fun there was karaoke in the bar. The hotel is right on the beach you can have a jug of frosty beer overlooking the harbour. We really enjoyed our stay here. Would definitely recommend for a stopover. The rooms were a bit old but it didn’t matter due to the space and comfy beds! ,Great location by the beach! The facilities are not new and would deserve some refreshing, but the place is a small jewel. Superb swimming pool available, lounge, restaurant and of course the small beach, with the boardwalk. Pulau Ubin is just across the channel and you can also hear and see the planes from Changi. Have not tried the seafood restaurant but it looks nice and tempting.",,,,10,3,46

iBackpacker @ Kallang,1.5,10 reviews,#273 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,kamar nya kecil, sprei nya kotor, selimut kotor dan berdebu. karena kamar saya sangat dingin ( padahal saya sudah minta untuk mengecilkan ac nya) saya terpaksa harus menggunakan selimut itu. kamar mandi nya lebih parah. kotor, tetapi air panasnya mengalir dengan baik, harganya memang murah tetapi saya lebih memilih mengeluarkan uang lebih untuk tempat yang lebih baik dari ini. di samping hostel ini ada restoran yang murah. dan hostel ini dekat dengan stasiun mrt,No matter how bad a hostel can be, i never have rated a hostel this low. Out of 25 countries I been backpacked, this is by far the worst. I know I am signing up for a really cheap hostel in the middle of one of the most expensive city on earth but I didnt expect to get this raw deal.  1) The location is excellent. Just less than 5 mins walk to Kallang MRT station and numerous buses in and out of the area.  2) There are 24 hours restaurants just 2 mins walk away from this hostel.  3) The receptionists are really kind.  4) wifi works really well.  BUT ...  1) There will be 4 to 5 men all day long just sitting in front of the hostel (mostly migrant workers). they are looking at us all the times when we go out and come in the hostel. honestly, i feel unsecured. do something about, it.  2) the street leading to the hostel, the shops and restaurants look tired and quiet all night.  3) the hostel is a bit rundown with paint and colours dilapidated. it looks so tired.  4) the room is small and no safety at all (at least the room i stayed has no safety box).  5) the plugs are far away from beds, and only has 2 in the rooms.  6) the cleanliness is OMG, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THEY CLEAN THIS?  7) the bathroom were mouldy, smelly, wet all the time and super black stains latched in the wall. dude, seriously?  8) i felt like living in a slump in one of the nicest city on earth.,…,I tried to stay at this place in July 2014.  Located in the Kallang area &  it only takes 5 minutes walk to the station (bus/MRT). The location is very good.  But when we arrived at his place, such like UHHH.. The room smells not good. The yellow mattress. The fug air. The super small toilet. The price for value like that is not make sense.  I will not go to that place again. ,ナショナルスタジアムに近いこと、4人グループの全員が一部屋に泊まれること、そして安いことを条件に探した結果、ここにたどりつきました。上の条件は全て満たしているので、その点は文句なしです。MRTの駅（Kallang）は徒歩圏内にあり、周りには中華を中心に食事をするところも多く、この点も良いと思います。そんな中で気になったのはトイレ、シャワー周り。トイレの便座が無かったり、壁に蜘蛛の巣が張っていたりと、少し手を入れればすぐに解消されるようなところに気が行きとどいていないので、毎日きちんと清掃しているのか？と感じてしまいました。あとは9時にリセプションが閉まってしまう点も、それ以降の時間に何かあったときには面倒でしょう。,we stayed in the family room, for the room : the air conditioner did not work properly, we could not turn the tv on because it was broken, the room is not spacious. the bathroom was nasty and really narrow , the picture in the booking.com is different compare than the real condition.  the positive thing just the location of the hostel",,,,119,19,69

U8 Hostel,3.5,17 reviews,#171 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Russian, Norwegian, Ukrainian","Share, ,Because Singapore is so expensive I chose a hostel, knowing that you get what you pay for. I chose to have a private room, which was actually a family room with bunk beds, but still very cheap. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, it had airconditioning, and fulfilled what I needed. The location was easy to find (right by the corner of 2 main roads), and it was close to both bus and underground stations, and had heaps of eating places nearby. It probably isn't somewhere I'd want to wander around at 1am, especially if I was a young girl, but was fine for me. The shower and toilets were semi-outside, and reminded me of the losmen I used to stay in as a backpacker 30 years ago, i.e. they weren't all that clean or comfortable, but survivable. I did not stay for breakfast, due to, an early flight, but it appeared that breakfast, which was apparently pretty basic, would be served in what looked like a laundry room! This is not a place for those who want good facilities, but it the room was clean and comfortable - if you want better than basic, pay more and go to a hotel,…,Room was fine, the atmosphere feels homey, but there was an annoying stranger who put his stuffs on our bed.. but well I can't complain because it's the risk of deciding to booked mixed dorm. Breakfast was very simple just toasts and coffee. The location isn't far from MRT station.  I traveled on January 2014.,Now, I will try to summarize my stay with as little profanities as possible. This time, I went for an 8 day trip to Singapore for business and leisure purposes and since the accommodation in the country is incredibly expensive, I decided to try a hostel. Upon arrival (it was incredibly difficult to find this place, it looked like an abandoned shop lot which ended up costing me a lot for my taxi ride because even the taxi driver couldn't find this place), I was ""greeted"" by the staff which was not only rude, but hostile in manners. Her name was Joanne if I am not mistaken. All I can say was that it was clear that I was unwelcome by the staff, particularly her. The room I choose was shared by 3 other people and you get a tiny table and a tiny locker that fits your bag pack only., If you have a luggage bag like I did, God help you. The doors are always open for the rooms and there are no places except the toilet that offers some amount of privacy. There is also no dining area, and the TV in the front was just for ""esthetics"" since we had no control over it anyway. You will not be provided with any access to the hostel without feeling like a prisoner. You will be yelled at. The cleanliness was seriously... repulsive. No new bed sheets, dirty floors, nobody takes out the trash and the toilets... absolutely repulsive. 8 out of 16 times I had to shower somewhere outside because it was too dirty and the other times because I had no choice but to rush to get to somewhere and forced to use it. About the breakfast, don't feel excited. It's just cheap, almost expired bread and jam with instant coffee. The staff always puts on loud vulgar music that disturbs the peace and with their already bad behavior, it makes this stay really ""memorable"".  Here are the excellent staff ethics that I experienced. -The rude staff Joanne* slept in my room with nothing but her underwear on the second night. -She refused to provide a traveler from India with a miserable pack of instant coffee at 5am (his check out time), because it's against her ""rules"". (Poor fellow had to travel so early back to India while no shops are open to buy coffee) -I paid for laundry and asked them to handle it while I went out for business, and when I came back I found my clothes wet and thrown aside. I had insufficient clothing for the following day. -I had a guest to come over (my girlfriend) and she was harassed by this Joanne and embarrassed me by coming into my room, at an inappropriate time and invading our privacy, several times. -she even spoke ill of me to the other roommates and staff because I complained about the laundry and caused me further embarrassment. Just too many more to list here. It was so bad, I had to check out 2 days earlier because I couldn't take it anymore and booked a hotel. I will never go for a budget hostel again. I will rather pay more and have my sanity intact than to deal with these uneducated, vulgar people. While I was staying here, I also discovered that the staff were staying in the hostel illegally, and the rude staff Joanne held several ""full time"" jobs at the same time and still claiming to be a ""full time staff of hostel"". I wonder if the owner of the establishment is aware of the situation in the hostel. I strongly discourage anyone from staying here. Go and spend a little more and have a good stay instead of burning your hard earned money here. p.s. don't believe the 7.5 ratings. They are given by white people who are treated like royalty in this god forsaken hostel. Of course they would give a high rating. I am Malaysian and treated like crap here. If you think that what I say is untrue, then go ahead and try this place.,…,We booked the family room with 2 teenagers. Massive bunk beds take up most of the room. Little room for luggage or to move around. Top bunks make a lot of noise with the slightest movement. Room itself was soundproof with good aircon. It was clean however, the rest (bathrooms, kitchen) was dirty. Pictures are deceptive in that respect. Was sufficient for us to get some sleep after a 1am check in. ,I think this hostel just think about money, don't think about your comfortable . I live here for 5 days , and then I just want to switch to bottom bed when all another bed empty , but they don't allow it , let's think again, all bed are empty , and you can't  move to another bad ??? what the hell ? i am fat guy , and has forced to climb to the top bed ?   so, if your first time visit you get bed on the top , what ever you live for a month , you will live on the top until you leave out . I recomend you find another hostel that not strict about the bed switching.",Budget,,,34,4,49

Hostel Amigos,4.5,10 reviews,#158 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Wifi,,"Share, ,There are few good things about Hostel Amigos:  1. AJ and Stan replied my emails many times before I came.. I count it as a good service.. 2. It was cheap compare to the other hostel.. 3. 5minutes walking distance to the Lavender MRT station.. 4. Pretty clean..  It's nice hostel..,This was the first time we stayed in this Hostel.  We stayed in a private room with windows.  Bedding, pillows and air conditioner all are good. Clean.  AJ is very friendly and gives us a  lot of useful advice for travelling around Singapore. Hostel location is good and near to MRT.  I would prefer staying in Amigos, rather than staying in those 3-star hotels.  Great value for money.  Highly recommended.,This was my second stay at Amigos. The first one was in January 2011 (see also my review). This time Amigos was fully booked therefore I couldn't get the double room, and stay at twin room at 3rd floor. I prefer the double room at 2nd floor since I was travelling solo and it is less stair. It was good as ever but since this time the hostel was fully booked, therefore cleanness was dropped a bit, you had to queue for bathroom (more less 15 minutes), a little late in restocking the breakfast and a little bit noisy in the morning. On the good side, the Lavender station has been upgraded, there are a lot of shops and eating places such Wendy's and Kopitiam which Lavender area is nicer and live. This time I took a walk nearby hostel. Turned out you can easily found 8-9 foodcourts, within 15 minute walking from the hostel and they are also cheap.,…,It is cheap and clean. There's free wifi and free breakfast (bread and milk) Near at MRT Lavender Station There's a near 7-11 and Hawker food station.  I stayed there for 9 nights last June, in a female shared room. The staff were nice too!,My stay in Hostel Amigos was a good experience. Beddings and pillow are comfortable, room temperature is ok, restrooms are clean, wifi is strong and there is a computer for anyone to use. AJ is friendly and accommodating. It is just 5-minute walk to the Lavender station. There is a hawker food place nearby, 2 7-11 stores, a Wendy's restaurant and other small food stations. I will be back here for sure.",,,,145,13,90
Oxford Hotel,2.5,170 reviews,#314 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,The Location Is Quite Good, 500 Meters From Nearest Subway Station. The Building Feels Old and Quite Spoooky, You Can Feel It When You're Using Elevator. The Room Was Quite Nice, It's Old But Quite Comfy After All. Air Conditioner Was Really Good and Bathroom Was Good. Overall I Give 3 Star From 5. ,Me and my brother stayed in a twin bedroom. Very functional. Good bed, comfortable, good shower, good Wi-Fi, staff spoke English, close to Bugis Junction and sim lim shopping centres. Quiet enough for quality sleep. ,First of all, the front desk person and even the manager are not polite. The room had a strong unpleasant odour. The carpet is dirty and the light is dim. The bed are uncomfortable and produced noisy sound.The hairdryer is spoilt and they will tell you they dont have additional one for you. No toothbrush toothpaste.,I booked in Oxford hotel a room for 4 persons,2 adults and 2 teen, but they gave me a triple room with 3 beds,3 towels,3 glasses notwithstanding they wanted to believe me the room was for 4 persons!!!

Hostel One66,4.5,11 reviews,#150 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,Stayed here with my 5/7 year old kids as we were only looking for one night as we were on our way to Legoland Malaysia. It's 10mins from the zoo and 10 mins from the border so perfect for us to get to the night safari and onwards travel to Malaysia. If you are a real backpacker you will love it, if your looking for 5 star you won't like it. It is set amongst high density apartment living, where real Singaporeans live, close to MRT, local food court next door. Yang the owner is really helpful and a great guy. And for a triple in Singapore for $65 it's a bargain. If like a lot of reviewers on here you complain because there may be a bug,a hair or a flake of paint chipped off a wall don't go, but if you looking for great value and safe experience/adventure then you will love it.,Every positive thing said about Yang is true. He is extremely helpful, friendly and funny. Downsides of our stay was the (semi)permanent residence of 4 guys in the hostel, which sort of degraded the hostel atmosphere. Also, prbably because of this, the kitchen and shower were kind of messy. Clothes lying around and things like that. Sleeping area appeared to be clean though.,You cant find another host like Mr. Yang. He's honest, friendly and very knowledgeable of what you can do and go to while in Singapore. You will get valuable insights from him to plan your itinerary and this will save you a lot of time and money.  The place is basic but clean and well maintained. The design is very unique and novel. Yang told me it was his father who designs most of the stuff. It's situated in a residential district so you can witness how local residents live and interact if you want to. Close to the metro station but may take you 45 minutes to get to the heart of the city. Groceries are near by and 2 mini hawker places are just within the cluster. I was on my last day when I saw a lady loading live crabs in an aquarium and decided I have to try the chilli crabs, and it was great! Although I dont have a point of comparison I do believe it was one of the best food i tried during my 5-day stay. I also got it really cheap for 26sgd for a really big live crab.,…,Stayed 1 night in this very creative hostel. It is a bit far from downtown but it is just next to the MRT station. The owner is so friendly and helpful. He change the HDB into a very creative hostel, although the building is old, but the hostel is well maintained and clean. Kitchen and washing machine is provided, very convenient for budget backpackers.  The comments and reviews from worldwide travelers are all over the bathroom wall, making the shower time more interesting by reading them xD.  I found it a little bit hot and stuffy in the afternoon as it does not have air-cond. But overall I think it worth more than the money value. I was taking train from Woodland check point back to Malaysia the next day so this place is just perfect for me :),I’m finding it hard to rate this place using the star rating system. It’s so incredibly basic, I’m afraid the four-star review will be misleading! But the value-for-money is almost impossible to believe, I can’t rate it anything less.   Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in Asia for accommodation… even basic offerings can hit the SGD$150 mark. But Hostel One66 offers a bed in their bunk-adorned dorm for just SGD$19 per night. More expensive options for a more private room are available.  This place is the brainchild of Yang, and based on the handwritten, spontaneous reviews on the bathroom wall, this place has been running as a hostel since at least 2005. I’m not sure why, but the glowing reviews from all around the world seemed to hit a peak around the mid-2000’s and, then seemed to dry up around 2009. Could it be a lack of wall-space? Or could it be that Hostel One66 has become less popular with the international backpacking crowd? Either way, the guests during my one-night stay weren’t your typical Euro backpackers… I was the only Ang Mo.   If you’re looking for a genuine Singapore heartland experience, this is the place. I don’t know of any other accommodation options that are (a) inside a Singapore HDB [Housing Development Board] building and (b) outside the main city area.  I’ve lived in the Singapore/Johor area for two years, and I can guarantee you… as a visitor to this island nation, this is the closest you will get to experiencing the “real” Singapore that is day-to-day life for the majority of the population.   Like all HDB addresses, it can be tricky to find, so put Yang’s mobile on your speed-dial… you’ll probably need it.   I will definitely be back, and look forward to hearing more from Yang, and what it’s like running a hostel in heartlands Singapore for (at least) the last eight years.,…",,,,79,2,64
One North Bridge,4.5,4 reviews,#167 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,,,"Share, ,Merlion Park,The Hotel offers free Wifi,Merlion Park,free wifi,Chinatown,great free WiFi,I stayed at One North Bridge for about 6 months and had an outstanding experience, based on which I would like to recommend this place to everyone. Here are little more details on my experience -  Apartment Visit and Selection Phase: During my first visit, Ms Veronica was very helpful to explain everything in detail. My first impression of the apartment after seeing it were: 1) it offers the best possible views that you can get in Singapore 2) the apartment has everything that you need for your living and the utilization of space is outstanding. I visited a few other options around Singapore and had to come back here for a second visit, which Ms Veronica dealt with similar energy as she did for the first time. My choice of this was rather easy given the two key facts mentioned, above; and also due to the prime location of this property that makes you live close to everything you need. The high street center is mainly an office building with only a few floors at the top being used for residential purpose - I viewed this as a positive too since this helps to reduce the crowd. The property is near to a few bus stops and just 3-4 minute walk away from a MRT station.  Moving in and the Apartment: On my moving in date I was told to contact the housekeeper Mr Tun; when I called his mobile he addressed me with my first name. I was impressed with that since it shows the professionalism of the management. Mr Tun helped me to bring all my luggage up to the apartment and he explained me about it and the facilities. During my initial discussions with Ms Veronica from the sales, I mentioned to her about my need of additional hangers and two sets of wine glasses. Those were ready and Mr Tun also did mentioned to me that you asked for them so they are here (which was a great experience as well since they take care of your wishes in detail).  My apartment is a 1BHK, close to 600 Sq Ft, is fully furnished & well decorated, has a fully functional kitchen, all appliances that you need for living (TV, refrigerator, induction hob with chimney, washer cum dryer, oven, microwave, toaster, kettle, rice cooker, Bluetooth music player, hair dryer, iron with board etc), has cable TV with HBO & Fox, high speed fiber internet with your own dedicated wired/WiFi modem (was super easy for me to set up my home office and TelePresence unit), has plenty of storage spaces (I couldn't utilize them all as I was living alone, even for a family of 3-4 the storage seemed to be good enough) and is extremely well lit. In both living room and the bed room, there are lot of full length mirrors that create an optical illusion of having more space through the reflection, which makes you feel better. The upper part of the glass windows can be opened in both rooms, making outside air circulation possible through the apartment. The queen bed was comfy with different pillow options as per the need. The working desk was good w.r.to both working space and storage but that was inside the bedroom, which may not be the perfect arrangement, but was manageable for me. The bathroom was also good with all required amenities to make me comfortable. The facility at the lobby level has two entrances, where one of them is manned 24x7 with a security personnel while the other one on the riverside being a more private one. The overall security arrangements of the facility is great with full CCTV coverage, 24x7 security personnel, 3 layers of locks/access requirement to get into your apartment and all secured doors in the common area of the apartment.  Ongoing Service: One North Bridge provides once in a week service, which is light touch and in my view is rightly balanced between the servicing needs and privacy. The service person Ms Helen is superb, always smiling with great attitude and she did an awesome job to help me keep my apartment nice and clean. The folks in the management office like Ms Unice are great. I always received prompt response to all my need and they were always informing me a week in advance before any scheduled maintenance activities. The finance department was very helpful to process all related matters promptly and provide the invoices in time. Overall, I felt it is all these great people with their great attitude and service, that makes this place even better to live.,…,1. The receptionist, Ms. Eunice Ong, she was very responsive, patient and helpful throughout the booking stages. we were booking from overseas. there is a little more things to be done than normally. 2. Location of this apartement is just perfect. Absolutely NEAR EVERYTHING. MRT PUBS SHOPS . you name it. ITS ALL THERE. 3. Cleanliness of the place is immaculate. bed sheets smell nice. furniture is spotless. 4. The helper. Mr.Tun. is very polite. helpful. pleasant and responsive to all of our request. 5. The chocolate bouquets and wine and snacks this place give out upon arrival may not mean a lot to other guests. they did have huge impact on our kids. they went nuts eating that many chocolates. 6. The rate they charge isnt cheap. but definitely they are not expensive compared to, other accommodation option all over singapore. 7. air conditioner is working very well and very cool. they provide 3 units. i only used 1. because they were very cool. 8. The furniture, microwave, fridge were very usefull and working perfectly 9. Internet is super fast.  10. the view scenery outside the windows you could see the Singapore ferris wheel. the marina bay sands. the sea. the flower dome. what else you could ask for. this place is truly a gem. thanks mr tun. thanks ms. eunice. you made our holiday very pleasant memory ,…,One North Bridge is very conveniently located for everything; sightseeing, working and so on. You can find many restaudants, shopping places nearby. One North Bridge is within easy access of the MRT station.,We've stayed a total of 4 weeks at One North Bridge Serviced Apartments. 2 Weeks on the 6th floor and 2 weeks on the 27th floor.  What was great: Very friendly and supportive personnel, booking and check in was super easy; service personnel very helpful and kind at any given time; helped me with printing and fax services; 27th floor has a great city view over Clark Quay; checkout was smooth and easy; central location is superb as everything is in walking distance; good rates for such a central location; nice small garden at 6th floor. What was rather disappointing: No swimming pool or gym facility available and not even a membership or cooperation with another hotel; deposit refund was issued more then 4 weeks after checkout so you may want to check this at time of checkout so, that you don't experience the same issue!,…",,,,473,122,100

The kitchen is realy nice and it is enought dishes to prepare food. It is not expencive .the breakfast is self servis- coffe, tea, krekers, toast bread, flakes...,It was my first time staying at a capsule hotel/hostel so I was excited but also wasn't sure what to expect.  This is my review from that perspective.  Noise - I stayed here with my sister so we got a capsule meant for 2 and I guess that was partially the problem; there were only 2 double capsules and they were both near the entrance & pantry so there's a fair bit of traffic there, which inevitably meant more noise.  It didn't help that: we were light sleepers, the only things separating the inside of our capsule and the entire dorm were a single layer of curtains, and we got the bottom capsule.  The first night was difficult.    Smell - The place as a whole was clean; pantry and toilets were well lit and furnished so no complaints there. The blanket and sheets of the bed were, fine too... but there's an inexplicable god awful smell (like feet smell) that would come in wafts when we were right outside our capsule (that's where our luggage and stuff was).  We couldn't locate where the smell originated from and it might have even been the stench of weary travellers but the recollection of it even now makes my nose hairs curl.  Privacy – Not much different from that of a dormitory style hostel aside from the curtains separating your capsule. You do get lockers for your stuff.  Location - Really a close walk to the nearest MRT station once we got our bearings right.  But our first Grab driver couldn't quite locate it - it's tucked into a corner near a couple of food places/pubs and a construction site (at the time of travel). One night not far from the hostel, a couple of men were yelling at each other nearing a fight (I assume they were inebriated).  It's not exactly a seedy area but this is just something to note.  Summary: Relatively affordable, clean, well equipped and public transport is easily accessible; trade off would be the noise and privacy.,…,This is an excellent, easy going hostel type place, very clean well maintain, higly reccomend it if you want something great, and excellent location, only 2 mnts from MRT station,  Very quite, good chance to speak to other travellers, easy access,,We really appreciate the location and the accomodation. We came at 1am and feels like the airport is just nearby. The MRT is a walk away. The accomodation is nice- with beg bed for you to put your things and have a good sleep. It's just that there was a strange guy when we get there- that's the only thing I rated it 4. But overall, the accom is good 😇😇😇",,,,124,19,69

I got bitten by an insect and in the morning I saw there was an insect crawling in the bed, looks like a small cockroach. The lighting is not good as well and the ventilation. The toilet gas hot shower and hair dryer so it is a good thing but it is not that clean.  If you are going to spend 25sgd, just add more and get a better dorm or hostel.

Bunc at Radius Hostel on Clarke Quay,3.5,157 reviews,#81 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),,"Share, ,I've booked a room of Bunc at Radius Clarke Quay in Nov 2015 (via a reliable hotel booking website that I don't want to tell because it's not their false at all) to stay when I and my friend join the Laneway Music Festival Singapore in the last week of Jan 2016.   About 2 weeks before the trip, my friend send Bunc an email to tell that we will check-in in late night because our flight was arrived at 11pm. Bunc send the confirm email back and say that it's okay and they already noted that to their book. Everything seems okay, right?   But on 7pm. (in Singapore), Bunc emailed my friend that we cannot stay at the room we booked because it's OVERBOOKED. why it's overbooked after confirm for many weeks?? why they told us that too late??? if you were us, how could you won't shock???, alright, they offered us a hotel that not far from Changi airport. but it's very far from the city and far from all the place that we plan to! this is HORRIBLE.   So we have to book another hotel to stay all 3 days in Singapore. we almost forget terrible things after that, BUT..   5 days ago, we found a cost from Bunc Hotel in my friend's credit card bill. The cost is 90 S$ for a night at that hotel. OMFG! We didn't even see their hotel door..  Maybe the worse is we still cannot contact Bunc Hotel, although we send several emails to them. the booking hotel website was trying to contact them too but it's like no any sign from Bunc at all. So the booking hotel web will give us the compensation. But Bunc should be the one who have to show the responsibility, isn't it???   Come on Bunc!,…,nice hostel, we booked a room for six person with 2 single bed and 2 double bed. the linen are clean also the bathroom. the location is near clarke quay mrt station, only 5 minutes walking. dont worry if you hungry at night because near the hostel there some restaurant that open 24 hours. breakfast only serve toast bread with assorted jam, some cereals and coffee tea. last good thing about this hostel that free wifi ( up to 5 Mbps),Hi Bunc Hostel,  What happened to your China female cleaners that you used to have? I think female cleaners are better for hostel environment since 50% of your guests are females. They also kept the place super clean last time.   Also, why are your cleaners staying at the same room as the guests in your Clarke Quay branch? This is degrading, who allowed this? And when they clean they put everything on the floor, which is disgusting.   Please remove them and hire your China female cleaners back.   I also find that your female receptionists last time are very polite, friendly and welcoming. Your male receptionists sometimes are aggressive and unfriendly.,I've been in a lot of hostels around Singapore, South east Asia, and Europe. But by far this is the worst and 2nd most expensive one. It's perfectly located in Boat Quay (South Bridge Rd.) area and has pretty good reviews, those are two reasons why i chose this hostel.. bad call!  1. 3 days, 4 different people, not a single smile.. the persons behind the reception seemed underpaid or something. Not so helping with questions & information also. 2. The breakfast was a joke. Just toast, cereal, coffee, tea... that's it! I've been in much cheaper hostels before, and they serve way better breakfast. 3. I don't know what is the ideal ratio between guest and shower/toilette, but I've never wait for toilette/shower in other full house hostel before, not that long. 4. Specifically asked, in email about the curtain at their bunk beds.. and they did confirm it! But they 'upgraded' me with the one with no curtain. 5. The luggage lock breaks all the time. 6. No common room. Just a lousy pantry. 7. Towels are rented.. a big minus.  There are many better lodgings near the area which has better price and facility.,…,Stayed at the CQ location for 3 nights and tried to avoid physically being at the hostel.  Good: The location is central and that's all you get (a block from the MRT).  Now for the bad part (And sadly there is a few): Air Freshener smell is super high. Owned by Indian folks, pretty sure, and they installed tons of auto air freshners to offset the smell. Service...basically college kids running the front desk and they seriously lack customer service. They give you a dirty look when you go in and out. A nice hi or nod would be more welcoming. Seems like they didn't want you there. Breakfast is awful. U get bread and spread. Don't be sold because they have breakfast included! It's just toast included! Dirty. Sheets were dirty and had hair all over... Had stains on sheets and, curtains were subpar. Oh don't bother booking the private room. Waste of money. It's basically a big closet that you sleep in located inside the mix dorms. The mix area and private rooms have zero windows. Basically if there was a fire, you would not know and be trapped in....seriously. Have no idea how Singapore's govt passed this place as acceptable living space given the effiecency of the country.  If I could have gotten a refund, I would have considered moving. Great for one night stay, but overly expensive otherwise. This place lacks the basics such as hooks to hang towels (which you have to rent for 8 sing), chairs to sits, lounge area to mingle, fun hostel spirit, etc. I value this place at 12-18 sing a night on weekdays, 20-25 for weekends and holiday strictly on location. Remember towels cost extra and bring a lock to store ur belongings. Good luck at this place. Sing is great but sadly this hostel ruin an otherwise perfect trip.,…",Budget,,,587,110,100
Box Capsule Hostel,4.5,15 reviews,#122 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Game room,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,We spent 4 nights in a 10 dorm capsules with my girlfriend. It was good, there was a lot more privacy compared to the other dorms we have been to. Concept of capsule is great. Location in Chinatown is also good, almost everything within walkin distance(if you like walking :)). I would recommend this to everyone under 190cm, there was just enough room for me as a 185cm, but capsule would be too short for longer people. I dont know if they have bigger capsules in some rooms.,This place could be the cheappest one in Singapore. We stayed in a mix dorm with 10 beds. Met some friendly guys from Philipin and Vietnam. Going out for China Town walking around 5'. MRT train station same time. Definitely come back and recommend to all friends traveling to Singapore.,I stayed there for one night in a 10 bed room. The lady at reception was lovely, the massage chair in the break room is excellent, and the whole place was clean and tidy. I thought that the capsule bed would offer more privacy, but unfortunately I was wrong. Every sound made in the middle of the night can be heard in the whole room (some vocal guest in the room made their feelings towards this known).  I cut short my stay to book a private room in another hostel. Having said this, this is no indication that the hostel or staff are bad, the whole capsule feature wasn't as private as I thought it would be.,Box Capsule Hostel is a great choice for those looking for a hip place to stay but is on a  budget. It was like staying in a house with your friends. The interior are always kept clean and sanitized. Footwear is not allowed inside. There is ample free breakfast at the pantry. While the bathrooms are co-ed, the shower and toilet are put in separate stalls. Security is also not a concern as guests are provided for their belongings while the front door is only accessible by a combination key lock given at check-in.   One thing I liked when I stayed here was when we arrived at 2 AM and we had no issued getting to the hotel and to our room. The staff were quick to answer our questions even at this unholy hour. :)   I would stay here again when I'm back in the SG!  Read more about my, stay at www (dot) themermaidtravels (dot) com/why-stay-in-box-capsule-hostel-singapore/,…,I had informed the hostel that we would arrive after midnight, so when I finally arrived, a night portier was at the reception desk, ready to check us in. The staff is super friendly, especially Miss Yani, who likes talking to all the guests and help them figure out what to do and where to go.  The rooms are nice and clean, and the beds have curtains, which gives you privacy and a good nights sleep. Every bed box has its own reading light and power outlet, and the mattress, pillow and blanket are all comfortable enough. The storage locker is quite small, but you can store your luggage in another room.  The showers and toilets are located downstairs, which is a possible disadvantage if your room is upstairs, but since I stayed in the room downstairs, I was quite satisfied with, it. The showers and toilets are mostly well cleaned.  A simple breakfast with cereals, toast, jam, peanut butter, fruit (apples) and eggs are provided free of charge, and the pantry is also nice and clean. On the first morning, there was no bread left when we wanted breakfast, but this didn't happen again.  For me, the location was perfect; close to the Maxwell Food Center where you can find great and cheap meals, China Town where you can shop for souvenirs, metro stations from where you can go anywhere you like, and everything else is also within a walking distance if you're up for a little exercise.  All in all, I was completely satisfied with my stay here; I stayed for 5 nights.,…",,,,1027,128,100

Canaan Suite,5.0,22 reviews,#104 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,We stayed in this apartment back in early December 2014. My husband & I and our 3 boys. We were greeted at the airport by the loveliest lady Joyce who took us on a tiki tour to our apartment pointing out places of interest along the way. Once  we arrived Joyce took me straight to the local supermarket to get breakfast for the morning. Joyce's apartment  was fantastic the beds were second to none two bedroom two bathrooms perfect for a family of 5. We loved the pool and found  the appt very handy to the bus stop and train station. We can't wait to go back Joyce was an amazing Host we would definitely recommend  this place to anyone.                                                                  Parnell Family,Joyce is very quick to respond & very helpful. She'll go out of her way to accommodate your needs. The apartment itself is elegantly decorated, new & clean. You can hear the road traffic but you'll get used to it. The neighbors are very quiet & the apartment building seems upper- class residence as I can see all the luxury cars in the parking downstairs. If you're going to take MRT, be prepared to take a bus transfer to the Eunos station as I don't think you can walk to the MRT, it'll take about 15-20 mins on average including wait time. Taxi fare from apartment to MRT is about S$5-6 (call fee $2 extra) whereas coming back is cheaper around $4-5.,My wife and I spent two nights in Joyce's two-bedroom apartment with a friend while visiting Singapore late in 2014. Later, my wife and I spent one night in Joyce’s one-bedroom condo. Both condos have a well-stocked kitchen, which adds their homey feel. We found each apartment to be extremely comfortable and clean with everything needed to ensure a good stay. The pool was wonderful for swimming laps. There are several neighborhood restaurants within easy walking distance.  Joyce, the owner, is a great hostess. She was very friendly and helpful - we even went shopping at a nearby mall with her! She is very pleasant, and deeply concerned that her clients have the best experience in Singapore while staying at her condos. As others have testified, Joyce thoughtfully ensured that all, the little extra's (such as MRT preload cards) were available for us to use. We cannot recommend this apartment highly enough. It's convenient for shopping and eating out. Also, it is convenient to the airport.,…,I stayed here for 2 nights in very clean one bedroom apartment few months ago with my partner. The rooms were exact what they shown in their web. we were absolutely tired when arriving but the staff gave us so warm welcome! The price wasn't cheap but I enjoyed every moment staying here.

I love the location ) near shops, and East Coast Park where I did had fresh air after traveling per day,i recently stayed in Joyce's one bedroom apartment with a friend while visiting my son and his family in Singapore and found the apartment to be extremely comfortable with everything needed to ensure a good stay. Joyce the owner was very helpful and friendly making our stay even better!  Joyce has thoughtfully ensured that all the little extra's (such as MRT preload cards) are available for her guests.

Village Residence West Coast by Far East Hospitality,4.5,192 reviews,#10 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,Been staying here for almost 8 months ++ and all I can say is the place is very safe, peaceful and clean. Staff are all friendly and able to assist us with whatever trouble we’re facing in our room with a smile. Would like to commend Mee Choo for keeping the unit clean every week. She is always ready to assist us without any complaints. Kudos as well to Sharifah for her good job and she is very friendly.  Overall, staying here has been a very good experience for us. Everything is just a stone throw away from bus stops, hawker stalls and grocery shops. Thanks a lot! ,We have been staying here from 16th August 2020 and the service provided by the management was excellent. We got immediate respone when we request for maintance service. The house keeping sercive done by Mahadevi was good and she was helpful. ,Eunice and Sharifa are hands down the most patient and understanding toursim service personnel.

Good location for bus transport, food finding, market & plaza.,I have had the pleasure of staying with Far Easy Hospitality at Village Residence West Coast, a prevalent serviced apartment complex, since my arrival in Singapore; February 2021. I was quite apprehensive upon my influx as I had just completed a mandatory, yet very solitary, 14 day Stay at Home notice (quarantine) at a local hotel.  My trepidation was quickly expunged as I entered the lobby of Village Residence West Coast, where I was swiftly greeted by the Guest Service Officer Ms. Sharifah, she pragmatically set me on my way to a freshly cleaned, and contemporary themed one (1) bedroom efficiency apartment.   Upon my introduction to the Residence Manager Ms. Nancy, it was effortless to observe why Village Residence West Coast is so efficient. It is undeniably a direct, reflection of her superior leadership skills.  The housekeeping staff is equally remarkable, Ms. Betty, Ms. Mee Chu, Ms. Fiona, and Ms. Devi are extraordinarily kind and always leave the units well renewed at each attendance  To illuminate the kind ways of the staff; I recently fell ill, the employees at Village Residence West Coast all voiced their concerns and surprised me with a “Get Well” fruit basket.  Each evening when I return to the Residence from work, I am often treated to warm salutations which only confirm that I am home.  Additionally, Village Residence West Coast, is conveniently location atop of the West Coast Plaza, where you can find many clothing, department, and grocery stores to suite your every desire.  There are several restaurants and a food court sited within the plaza.   Captain Richard Smith,…","Charming,Great View",,,59,9,66

Experience a homestay where you feel like in a asian museum. Quiet classical music is being played while you have a deliciously prepared breakfast. After wandering around in town, relax on the indoor pool. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful every moment of your stay.,no answer to all my mails. dont understand why the get so manny good feed back. even when the dont got any free rooms the must let you. waist my time wait for answer. never comes send a few emails. how people book ,dont understand. no kind regards from somsac,This is my third stay in Singapore. Before all the hotel experiences were not so good. L Residence is a great experience to me. Nice quiet area surrounding by trees. A great home with several generations of history here. Great breakfast. I feel l am home here. Will not consider others when next stay in Singapore.,We booked this hotel for my in-laws as it's pretty near our house and is a decent price (for Singapore).  The hotel is located on a small street near the botanic gardens. It is a bit far from most other Singapore tourist attractions, but Singapore is pretty small and easy to get around. The hotel is built out of an old mansion and the few rooms and the building are beautiful and very large. My in-laws raved about the breakfast and the service at the hotel - however, I would have to agree with other reviews here that it can be very difficult to get in touch with anyone at the hotel and the place is very hard to find.   Overall I would say I really like this place and we'll use it for other visitors in the future. However, since the hotel seems to be run as more of a hobby than a, business I would caution overseas guests to call the hotel and get direct contact with a person (write down their name!) as well as specific instructions - including the house number! - to the hotel for taxi drivers.,…,This is a private residence full of a family's history and treasures. From the moment your are greeted by Yenti, and the staff, you are treated like an honoured guest. I arrived late after a bad plane ride, and feeling ill. In no time, my bags were in my room and a supper of toast made and brought up. The room was large and clean, with a huge bed and TV, and full of character. It was very peaceful and quiet, and I sleep very well, something I have trouble doing at home. A largish ensuite, modernised and clean was at the end of huge storage cupboards. The pool was refreshing after being out and about, and again, in beautiful surroundings. I would not stay at a hotel again in Singapore, after finding this gem. This is an ideal place to stay if you want to immerse yourself in some, Singaporean history, have a comfortable warm stay, where you can come and go as you please, and return to be greeted by smiles.,…","Romantic,Charming",,,25,6,62

Capsule Pod Boutique Hostel,3.5,140 reviews,#106 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Burmese, Vietnamese","Share, ,I booked this hostel through Booking.com for my daughter and her friends visiting Singapore in October. Payment has been made in advance on 10Sep18 via credit card.    After the girls have checked in, the hotel manager/property owner by the name of Keith called me to produce documents for the 3rd party booking. He was being difficult and insisted that I follow 100% of his requirements. Unwilling to resolve the misunderstanding, he threatened to cancel the booking and hanged up the phone on me! I tried calling him back 5 times and he didn’t want to answer my call.  Instead, he barged into the girls’ room and demanded cash payment or they will have to vacate the room. The girls called me and when I ask them to pass the phone to him, he didn’t want to take the phone and told them, he do not want to talk to me! Even when I was willing to accede to his initial requests, he still refused to listen and insisted on cash payment. I called Booking.com to help mediate but the customer service officer failed to convince him too.    It was already midnight and the girls had to come up with cash to pay him. He didn’t show any remorse at all.   I asked Keith for a confirmation that he has cancelled the credit card transaction but he refused to give me any. It’s been 6 days and I have yet to receive my credit card refund. I sincerely hope I have not been scammed.   This is by far my worst hostel experience ever! It shouldn’t even be called a hostel. A detention house suits them more. Avoid this place at all costs!   ,…,Where to begin...  Some of the staff members are very rude. When you book they take your card details to charge the booking cost immediately, and they took an extra £105 out of my bank account on top of booking payment. They initially said it wasn't their mistake. However I persisted and they admitted their error after 5-10 minutes. Tried to get a refund on the full payment (including international transaction fee) but they only refunded me the transaction. No apology and eventually managed to sort it out after 3 weeks. Luckily I'm persistent. I can't imagine how many people get charged extra on their card without realising.   Because they take full payment on booking there is zero flexibility on bookings if your plans change even slightly. Very strange for a hostel. Don't, bother staying here.   Bathrooms are small and cramped. And you want to use the showers and toilets you have to walk by reception every time.   Stay elsewhere. ,…,Was only in SG for the weekend. Had an early morning flight so arrived at the hostel at around 6AM to leave our things- their reception desk however is only open 8AM to 12 MN. Their staff was already seated at the reception desk by 7:30, tried to check in at 7:50 since we were only planning to leave our things and go out to explore the city- but the girl refused to entertain us until it's exactly 8:00 AM. The girl just pointed at the wall clock, saying, it's not yet 8:00 AM. What a way to welcome their guests.   Checked out at  exactly10 AM the next day- was planning to leave the bags at their concierge since we'll be having a late night flight but we were told they can only hold our bags until 6PM- if we collect it later than that, then we'll have to pay additional fee.   You, are not allowed to stay in the common area after you check out- you'll be asked to leave right after you collect your things. One of their staff literally asked us to leave when they saw us sit for a few minutes in their common area to sort out our things.   The staff is quite rude and don't really care about their guests.   The Bathroom is terrible- the toilet flush is weak and space is very small.  The beds are clean though, it seems the linens are changed regularly. That's probably the only good thing about this hostel. Lots of better serviced hostel out there.,…,Avoid avoid avoid!!! Complete scamers!! Booked this place via booking. In the special request I asked to check in after my arrival 23:50 to the airport. The answer I got was:  ”Hostel do not have 24hours, front desk, last check in stated is by 23.30hrs. Front desk close at 00:30hrs, the next check in time will be 08:00hrs.”  Thus, since they stated they would not let the night that I booked I asked them if they could please cancel my booking because I needed to find a place that would actually lodge me.   I got no answer and my arrival date was coming closer and closer. I asked again to please cancel my booking for free.  Their answer the was: ”We are unable to modify your reservation as the reservation was booked with booking.com. Kindly contact booking.com for cancellation, however, your request is subject to booking.com policies approval.”  Well this is also not true. They can modify their own bookings and it is not subject to bookings policies. They make their own policies.  I then asked for a free cancelation through booking website. Now I got a very quick reply stating that they refused my request for free cancelation and that I would have to pay the ful cost. So, they will not lodge but they will still make me pay for staying there. Outrageous. I’ve been pleadu g to booking to help me but nothing has happened. The only activity regarding this is that yes, they have charged my card for 7 days stay. And I had to book a new place to stay and are paying for that to. In this new place they are very responsive and caring.   So my advose is: avoid Capsule Pod Boutique hostel!!! They are completly unserious scammers!!,…,My recent experience with the hostel was kind of shocking. My friend left some necklaces in the room and realized she forgot them after the cleaning lady went to clean the room. She went inside to search and they were gone. We told the property and they said they didn't find anything but we all knew that the necklaces were inside. After we told the manager, he started about that they don't need our necklaces and people have forgotten more expensive stuff, and how expensive could a necklace be. Childish behaviour I would say. But the next thing is worse. We showed our frustration because we expected a more nice behaviour from the hotel and they decided us to not let us stay at the hotel right after we went in the room. Like throwing us out they told us to leave, instead of, apologizing. This shows guilt. ,…",Budget,,,728,117,100

We booked a quad room, with four single beds, a large window and no TV. The room was clean and tidy. I think the best part for me was the sleep quality we had. The next morning, we had a free breakfast (coffee, apple juice, milk, cereal, bread and etc.), which was satisfying enough for me. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there.,I spent a Sat nite in the windowless room. Dirt under the bed was disgusting. While packing my bag, I made the mistake of taking my passport out of its carrying pouch (with some other docs such as a vaccine record and another country ID).  I put my passport with my electronic ticket print out. Finished packing without realizing the pouch had fallen not inside the backpack, but somewhere between bed and luggage. Luggage was stored for the day and until around 3:30 pm when I came to pick it up.  At the airport I realized what had happened.  Rushed to my next city (Jakarta), spoke to new tour leader and contacted hotel with a forwarding address where I was going to stay 2 weeks later.  Hotel denied having found anything. Two days went bye and I kept asking so they said it had been, found. I offered my credit card to pay for Purolator to forward it to the last hotel on my trip. they found different excuses not to do it.  In the end they wanted me to sign a list of what had been found before submitting it to my country's consulate. Operating on a cell phone, I had no idea how to sign the list.  They didn't want to purolate it to Bali either.  In my opinion,had they cleaned the room well when I left at 9 am on Dec 16, I could have had my pouch on Dec 29 in Ubud!,…",Modern,,,261,40,100

The environment was dusty with thick dust you could see on the fan, wall and every corner. I could not breathe when staying inside the room.

True, it is very humid in Singapore, and you will have an AC in your room, but I dread to think how moldy inside the AC unit is. This place needs an overhaul to remove all the mold and then I would give it five stars because the staff and facilities were great-mold just (literally) makes me sick and grosses me out!,The room is so small which is reasonable for backpackers.

The alcoves were great because my husband and I could take separate alcoves and not affect each other through snoring, while still being close to each other, and not paying for 2 full rooms.   The place is well managed and thoughful of visitor needs. For the price range and location, and sleeping arrangements, we are very happy and would be glad to come back.,Blanc Inn is a great place to stay. There are so much hawkers center in the surrounding are. There are bus stations nearby. For MRT, there are EW line and DT line nearby too. As for the facilities, there is a great living room, few shared toilets(clean). Room is small but it will not be a problem if travel alone. I would go back if I travel there again,I was very happy to spend 5 nights at Blanc Inn. Spotlessly clean alcoves and toilet/washing facilities and a very comfortable communal area where I could do some work. Miss LG is a lovely host, happy to chat and give advice about the area. I definately use again,This is not a regular hostel, it offers small ""room"" (enclave),  divided by curtain and folding door. You can lock the door from inside only. Overall, the place is very clean with sufficient toilet and bathroom. The aircond is installed in the common area in between the enclave, and there is fan provided in each enclave. There are only 4-5 enclaves in a room (security code required for access).,Staff was very hospitable and assisted me in determining routes for public transport, local cheap finds,  and must-visit places that are off the beaten track. Moreover, they always see to it that everything is convenient for me and they took care of me like I was part of their family, especially since I was there all alone for quite a while.","Modern,Budget",,,258,26,93

Both reception girls was nice. Shared bathroom for all the guest. Conveniently located near Lavender MRT. Easy access for us to explore the surrounding area especially for food hunting.   ,I got my room for a cheaper rate via Agoda. For the amount I paid, it is really value for money. The rooms are spacious, and cold. They provide lockers for everyone. Breakfast is average. They provide laundry service and towels for rent at a very cheap rate.  The staff are really very approachable, helpful and friendly. The best thing is this hostel is near a grocery store and just a few minutes walk from MRT Lavender station.  Cheap food is everywhere. The facilities are a little bit old. Wifi is strong. There is no hostel atmosphere. There are older guests who are staying here for a long time. If you are on a budget and you want to be centrally located, choose this hostel. I will definitely stay here again next time I visit Singapore!,It is in 2nd floor of that building, 1.5 KM from little India. As the room was free, they allowed to check in around 11:00am. We didn't had breakfast in the hotel, so no comments. This is the first time visit to Singapore, so not sure whether it was value for money.,Location is really good because just near MRT Station, food court and some mini store. Hostel is so so and wifi is good connection. Even the breakfast is just only toast bread, we can go and eat at near food court it is not expensive. The room is not really nice and my friend got bite by bug ( a room near the toiled on the right side of reception counter).,The hostel near mrt lavender, food court (kopitiam, Mc Donald, etc), 7 eleven, mini market. 24-hours drinking water is available (hot, cold, coffe, tea).

Very much satisfied for their services. Location is near to bussiness center and malls... Easy to find your way around...Safe place with very hospitable welcome.....,Reception staff pleasent , room poor ,small  with very badly stained floor rug .Air con ineffective , shower room too small and mouldy. Requested room change which was not much better . Spoke with other transit travelers en route to airport who experienced similar issues .,If you can, please avoid this hotel! When you do your hotel searches in Singapore, this will always come up as the most cost effective 4-5 star hotel however, there is nothing top quality about this hotel.  Staff claim that this hotel is a heritage listed building and all improvements have been made inside the rooms which in all fairness is true however, hygiene needs a major overhaul. Bed linen is hardly changed, toiletries never replenished, air con vents never dusted, toilet sit never cleaned ...l could go on and on but l'm sure this gives you an idea of the sort of place this is.  If you're travelling with children, do me a favour and just use reputable hotels. For the sake of an additional SG200 you can  enjoy your hard earned cash elsewhere but here. ,I have stayed at Link Hotel for 2 weeks and overall it has been a really great experience.  First of all the room is very clean and tidy, comes with tea-preparing facilities and all the necessary amenities that are expected at every hotel. The linen is fresh too.  However, I think the amenities such as wifi and air conditioner certainly need to be upgraded. I had a hard time connecting to the wifi in the room and got disconnected quite frequently.  Majority of the staff are very attentive to my request, but certainly some need to be more professional when communicating with the customers.  I believe that this shouldn’t undermine the good part during the stay, I would like to thank(I think) Mr. Melvin or Mr. 瑞彩祥云for the prompt response to my request such as replenishment for, coffee sticks all the time and I receive very efficient service after my request! He was also very polite too.  Besides. I would also like to thank Ms. Nana, she offered to bring me a fan while waiting for the aircond to resume operation and offered me a room change for cause apparently,it is going to take longer than expected.  I would also like to thank all the staff who is in charge of delivering food to the door every day and not forgetting to remind the guest by pressing the doorbell, the staff who escorted the guest to a various location, I think that they deserve the credit too!

The location is great, it is very near to bus station, easy to reach so many attractive sites, very close to 24h mart. I highly appreciated for my roommate, a Malaysian guy who is very helpful when I arrived to check in before time, Taiwanese guy who is very kind to help me to lend his own electric phone charging (in Singapore mostly we use triple legs as in picture) and a Hongkong student for a delicious gift :) and one more is Mr. Allan the owner of this hostel waiting me until I come back from Universal Studio and Sentosa beach maybe around 11:00 PM. Thank you so much for making my journeys trip is very peaceful and joyful. And most of guests who I meet from Europe, Asia and everywhere are very welcoming and friendly. , I will stay in Golden Hostel again if I have a next trip to Singapore. Cheers ;),…,First, the adress in booking.com is the wrong one. So we had to ask a few taxi drivers to find the hostel, because of the wrong adress we had we couldn't find it with public transport. Second, we arrive in the ""reception"", we were welcomed by two people who couldn't speak enough english to explain anything. So they reach out to her son who came 15 minutes later. In this time the older woman makes photos of our passports and wanted money for the the room, although we already paid via booking. She showed us a multi beds room, but we booked 2 beds room. Then they showed us ""our"" room, which wasn't clean and wasn't ready for us. We don't feel safe at all, so we left and went to another place...,I have enjoyed my stay at Lotus. Kim and Roy are good persons with lot of fun and good vibes to make you confortable and secure. Yes it may be a budget hotel but it is one that care that their customers. Free wifi, breakfast with Nutella (uncommon enough to tell), coffee-tea and common areas are there for everyone to enjoy. The environment including the rooms is tidy and cleaned everyday. Air conditioning in each rooms. Bus stop is a 5 minutes walk and the closer MTR is a 5 minutes drive by bus. Easy to get.

5footway.inn Project Chinatown 2,3.5,342 reviews,#82 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,Well, to be honest the hostel is fine. Room that we stayed in for days is okay the only thing is that, it was never been cleaned. The staffs are okay except for one girl at the last day. But aside from that everything is okay! ,This place is more than overpriced!! We stayed in the smallest little “room” with a loft. Definitely one of the dirtiest places I’ve ever stayed at. It looked like they hadn’t vacuumed for weeks as we saw dust balls as big as my fist.  “Breakfast” was included, white bread with butter or milk with Kellogg’s. We expected more for the price we paid since the rooms were extremely frugal. They were cleaning the bathrooms at 9.30 in the morning for 30 minutes, and during that time you couldn’t use any of the toilets. A big problem. Staff was not friendly at all.  Only good thing was location!! Walking distance to a lot of food courts, marina bay, gardens by the bay etc. Although I would rather stay at a place in a worse location than to experience this again. Wouldn’t recommend this, place to anyone. ,…,The location is amazing, right next to Chinatown main street, in a quiet corner, though. It is a walking distance to Raffles Place or Clarke Quay, just perfect. The hostel is clean, offers you enough facilities (room + bathroom-wise) and privacy (male-female bathrooms). The breakfast is included in the price/night and although basic it's a good way to start into the day.  Last year I stayed in a brother hostel (at Clarke Quay) and was therefore a bit disappointed by this one: the room had no window and was very very small. The reception is located in another building, so going there meant first walking out of the hostel. The staff was not very motivated, once I had to wait for 20 minutes for them to appear so I could pick up something from my luggage. Also, if you are looking, for a solo traveler-exchange experience, you won't find it here, the guests were rather locals, no backpackers and there is no social area to hang out at anyways.,…,I stay here for 3 days, short trip only. Everyday they give small breakfast. Easy to go & bring. Room was nice, bathroom was ok. Internet need to improve, sometimes lost signal, sometimes can. If more budget you can try.,I stayed at 5footway.inn Chinatown 1 (on Pagoda Street) back in spring 2015 and think it was all right - not very good but all right. This time, Chinatown 1 was all full so I stayed at the Chinatown 2 location on South Bridge Road. It turned out that it is much worse here.  This whole place is very cramped. The bathroom is very small, with tiny washing basins. There is no way not to splash the water out and wet your clothes when washing your face. It is also not very clean. One morning, I even saw a dead cockroach on the carpet in the hallway.  The overcrowded problem extend to dining area. The breakfast is included and quite basic. However, the dining area on ground floor is so small that some guests have to sit on the sidewalk outside.  I desired my privacy and stayed in a, twin room with bunker bed. While the room is small (which is expected), I was surprised that there is nothing else, like a basic table/desk, bed stand, or even a chair, inside the room. I had sitting in my bed to do all the work.This small room cost more than S$80 per night.  The only good thing about this place is its convenient location (right in Chinatown and near Singapore's ""nightlife row""). The Wi Fi is also relatively fast, but I guess that Wi Fi is generally good everywhere in Singapore.  Overall, this place is overcrowded and overpriced. There should be many other budget places to stay in Singapore (even in Chinatown neighborhood), so I do not recommend it.,…","Budget,Centrally Located",,,889,126,100
Chic Capsule Otel,4.5,262 reviews,#16 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,- Comfortable and Safety for woman solo traveller - Staff very friendly  - Free Breakfast - Free Shuttle bus to Airport 2 times/day (on 11.30 and 15.00) - Nearby China Town MRT stn. - Nearby China Town point,Very accommodating staffs, especially Naz and Girlie, they made sure that we are always comfortable and always says yes to our little requests 😊 Hotel was very close to the mrt, also has great food around the area😊  Though bathroom should be improved.   But overall, I would definitely recommend Chic Otel Capsule to my pinoy friends and relatives.,For sleeping in an 8 bed dorm, the room itself was restful and surprisingly quiet. I never had any issues waiting for the bathroom in the room or the larger co-ed one right outside the room. The staff was super helpful. Each bed area has a TV and lighting and ample power supplies to charge up all of your devices. The bed area was pretty big for a dorm and comfortable. Towels are provided. The area in Chinatown is amazing, so many great places to eat and you're able to walk basically anywhere you want to go. Also, it's close to the MRT. The ""key"" to the room is a bracelet you scan, so that was cool too. Breakfast is simple but good to have a sandwich before you hit the road. The price is super high for a dorm compared to the rest of the world, but fair for expensive Singapore.,Spent 5 nights here, i think their best asset is their ability to make their guests comfortable, safe and welcomed. They also anticipate their clients needs hence before you even ask, you are being offered to be helped in your need(s). I guess their only cons are failure to inform the guests to bring their own slippers (good thing i read the reviews) - bring own slippers because there isnt a partition in the toilet and shower area. Also the lockers are abit loud when accessing/closing,Wonderfull stay at Chic Capsules Otel. The staff is incredible and very helpfull! Will come back for sure! They help you visit the city and plan activities. Also they informs you about the dos and donts in Singapore.","Modern,Centrally Located",,,708,117,100
The Maxwell Reserve Hotel,4.5,97 reviews,#127 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),Chinese,"Share, ,The hotel is like a time machine into colonial times ... I didn't actually stay ... I had tea and sandwiches at their lobby bar - the Social Library. The interior of the hotel and this space itself are just one of a kind. The library is very well stocked and organized by topics especially related to botanic, exploration and nature. Checkout their infusions at the bar counter, its a neat place.  Food and beverage selection, was good, presentation could need some minor improvements and service needs direction and supervision. Been to a few Six Senses and its all about the little touches what make the difference.,Did an impromptu staycation over the weekend at the beginning of the year and was very satisfied with the experience.   I normally do not like 'shophouse' or 'boutique hotels' but the property manages to make me forget that. Everything in this hotel was properly curated right down to the welcome drink at check-in and the room amenities. I wanted to walk around Tanjong Pagar after checking in but end up staying all day inside my room as it was really comfortable (although on the smaller side).  Didn't manage to try out the F&B within the hotel but will be sure to come again soon!,My husband and I went to Six Senses Maxwell for our wedding anniversary. The little touches were what made our experience special.  From the welcome bowl ritual (you have to do it if you visit!), to the small chime at our bedside table, to the glass bottles in the room to eradicate single-used plastic bottles (they bottle their water on-site!), to the herb garden by the pool and the social library that serves as a reading and eating area... these make this hotel really special.   The staff also surprised us with a bottle of wine and cake in our room for our wedding anniversary, which we enjoyed on our first evening.   The staff were all attentive, polite and clearly took pride in working in this quaint heritage hotel. Thank you for having us!,Six Senses was a cosy place and the ambiance was awesome. Above all the food at Brasserie was wonderful. I am at awe of Mr. Pandian who was handling his team so well and taking care of the guest in details. He could remember all our food ordered even without note it down, and it came perfectly. Every food recommended by him liked by my kids. He was so friendly towards my kids too and know what best for them. I understand he is a F&B Assistant Manager, but for my surprised he functioning as overall in charged of the entire F&B team. Even the kitchen staff and a lady chef confirming things before proceeding with menu. Good job all.,We flew in and had a short 3 nights stay at The Six Senses. The property was gorgeous and charming. Good location and reasonably priced. Room and hotel amenities were clean and relatively new. We had the pleasure to be served by the hotel manager, Mr Mark, whom was very kind and professional in his manner. Pointed out some real good eateries and recommended an itinerary for us too!🙂👍🏽 Generally, a true service professional.  All was excellent with the exception of one staff whom was mending the reception counter which got us a tinge upset. A lady, Wan-Ting, was rather unhelpful and had given us the""not so interested"" aura when we were asking her for some directions towards the metro. Her answer for a later check out was also blunt, with a straight 'no' upon us requesting. , All in all, we had a blast in Singapore and in this property.

We tried almost 80% of the food on the in room dining menu and was pleased by the quality of the food although it was now served in paper containers instead of plates. Food was hot as well when delivered. Dine at the restaurant for breakfast as well. You might consider improving your alfresco area lighting as it was a bit dim and increase fan speed cause hot. Birds are spotted everywhere also eating guests' leftover which caused a nuisance during our breakfast., Plus you need to station a few staffs at the alfresco/outdoor area cause we and the other guests were waving our hands mad for someone to notice us,…,Booked 2 rooms for a birthday celebration with my friends.

Avoid Room 303 at all costs! And their front desk personnel is such a pain! They don't know services. And challenges the persons making payment. At best they are rude because they think people are at their mercy for needing a room there. At worse they are glorified clerks who speaks English but knows nothing of the service industry. These are people who cant find jobs in any industry except for such a low budget business. There are some places that you only put your worse enemies into. I totally regret paying the deposit and have to follow thru paying for my staff to stay there for a month.,My sister, her friend and I visited Singapore for the first time last week and we decided to stay here in this hotel. Actually I have no issue about our whole stay here except maybe for the heater not working properly. The hotel staff is responsive, everytime we'd go outside to explore the streets, we'd come back to our room looking clean and renewed.

But unlike last time,  when we came here along with a bunch of family members, this time we kept it short at just the three of us. Singapore as always is ever mesmerizing and the warmth of this visit him catapulted to another level owing to our accommodation option ie Hotel Arianna at Syed Alwi road,  little India.

ST Residences Novena,4.5,65 reviews,#54 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,This was my third stay at ST Residence Novena (formerly Forest by Wangz).  We booked a double apartment and a Studio for the four in my family, and had recommended to two other friends who stayed in apartments there around the same time.  With the exception of the brilliant Chef at breakfast who is still very customer focused and a real asset to the business, the standards in this service apartment has drastically declined under new management.  The rooms are very worn and poorly maintained. The aircon in all the rooms smelt musty and had dirty vents, the kitchen areas were very worn, the bathrooms had visible mould.  As much as I have enjoyed my previous stays because of great service, the design of the unit and the convenient location, sadly unless it goes through a major, refurb I will not be returning. There are newer, more competitive places to stay in Singapore and the ST Residence Group need to wake up because they have significantly overvalued what they now offer at ST Residence Novena.,…,I have stayed here a number of times and been very pleased with the service and the friendly staff. It was great to have breakfast included. However, on my last stay it was apparent that the standards have now gone down to the detriment of the customer. The breakfast room was now closed and there was no lounge area open. Still charged the same rate of course. The rooms were beginning to look really tired and not well maintained. They were also cost saving by turning down the air con, which was hardly working. Not a great place to stay anymore.,Great location, friendly service, comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen (for me, it is missing a toaster though)  Below average housekeeping standards (fridge and microwave were not well cleaned at check in)  Apartment is showing its age (molds in shower area/walls which housekeeping claimed it cannot be cleaned while I can easily scrape off; molds on external structures)  Basement carpark is infested with mosquito  No temperature checks throughout my week long stay! Public areas are sanitized twice a month only! Not acceptable given the virus situation.....,If you would like a clean studio apartment to stay in with excellent staff and good facilities then look no further. When we arrived a tall gentleman with glasses greeted us from the taxi and booked us in. He showed us to our studio apartment on the 2nd floor. It contained a full size fridge, small hob, microwave, kettle, sink and utensils. We had a queen sized bed with en-suite shower room.The bed was so comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. When we booked we had breakfast included although since then it has changed and it is now an added extra. The breakfast was ok. You could get an omelette or fried eggs with bacon and beans if you asked the chef. Otherwise there was tea, coffee, water and juices plus a selection of Asian food which changed daily, pastries, fresh, fruit, cereals and yoghurt. You could sit inside or outside on a covered patio area. They also had a small outside pool on the ground floor. We used this once during our stay. It was quite refreshing as it was not heated. They also provide pool towels for your use. One of the nicest features of this hotel was the roof terrace. It had areas with lovely sofas and side tables where you could sit and chill on an evening looking at the city around you. It’s covered with a pagoda with a glass top so even if it’s chucking it down with rain you can still go up there. We sat up there watching the rain one evening. The reception staff we found to be very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to stay and wouldn’t hesitate to go back to again.,…,We stayed here for 8 days on our first trip to Singapore.  Everyone was very helpful giving us directions and any assistance we needed.  I need to mention some of the staff who made our stay so great.  Russell at the front desk greeted us when we arrived and said good bye to us when we left.  After a 18 hour flight from Newark, NJ it was so nice to have someone treat you as if you were so welcome and made you feel at home.  The Chef Jeremy had to be our favorite!  Everyday, except Sunday, he greeted us for breakfast with the most “happy happy” attitude it made your day.  Breakfast including a buffet plus eggs and bacon made to order is included in the room rate.  Janet who cleaned our room everyday was so efficient and nice.  The linens used were FourSeasons quality.  Nora at, the desk at night greeted you back after a day out.  The hotel is very good ...the staff makes it excellent!,…",,,,158,8,76
Plaza Premium Lounge - Singapore T1,3.5,34 reviews,#142 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),English,"Share, ,One would expect a nice lounge in Singapore airport but my experience was different. We stopped over for breakfast before boarding to our connection flight to Bali. There was not much food for choice for breakfast. The toilet facilities were not clean at all. I should have gone to McDonald's for breakfast.,Those who are disappointed by the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal One should try to use the Plaza Premium lounge instead. It beats all the *G lounges added together. Nice seating areas and good food offerings (including cook-to-order choices) plus open views of the runway - what else would one need? - showers available too.,Travelling long haul I’m always grateful for a hot shower and a comfy spot to chill and charge.  We pre-booked access to lounge online for approx SING $85.  Easy to find but service quite poor, staff were behaving bothered when you had a question or needed assistance (what’s wifi password, can I book shower for specific time, etc.)  Chairs comfy but stained.  Food plenty but not a big range.  Soft drinks included in price, alcohol extra Showers clear and good water pressure and lots of hot water.   Definitely not Qantas standard. Did not feel welcomed, more like an imposition.   Next time would just use shower facilities here and not purchase whole lounge package. ,Been this lounge many times in past 5 years. It's still as user friendly but condition has been deteriorating fast. Carpet and seats are full of stain to a degree visitors will be turned away. Despite rule disallows custom uper to sleep on sofa, this scene was quite common and staff took no action. Finding a corner to rest without dirty furnishing and misbehaved customer becomes difficult. Alcohol stops at 12am but it usually got limited before this time. No problem but quality of beer could be better. Attention should give to improve variety of dishes too. ,Good space to get away from the maddening crowd if you have a few hours until your flight.  Comfy sofas and loads of side cubicles to chillax at & charge up but food station was a big let down - veggie options severely limited you have to ask the chef to make you something - if he/she is around, and as a fee paying customer, why should you be put at a disadvantage compared to carnivores who have a wide range of dishes to choose from.  The loos are also tiny. Need to take note from the lounges at Doha International Airport in terms of service and set up.",,,,112,51,85
Cube Boutique Capsule Hotel At Chinatown,4.5,556 reviews,#23 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,This hotel was over packed when we stayed but had a friendly vibe staff were nice and helpfully, everyone was drinking and eating together outside the hotel people was playing music really good place to get to know people, we had a room for 4 people no air conditioning and really basic good if you on a budget   Stayed 2017,This is my one of the best experience. I never tasted this kind of things ever before. Thanks for the service And management has playing vital for providing best for theit customers. I'll definitely suggest to my friends and family.,We booked for two nights ended up staying for just one as my husband couldn’t stand the heat in the pod itself at night.   The pod hotel is modern and quirky and an exciting experience. The dorms and pods are clean with adequate storage. The beds and linens comfy.  There’s is little to protect you from the goings on outside of your pod (just a blind) but people are generally respectful of each other.   There is good aircon in the dorms but this doesn’t cover the pods and we found it to be stifling.  Ample shower and toilet facilities but not all travellers are concerned about tidying up after themselves and so sometimes they were quite dirty.  A great opportunity to stay somewhere a little out the norm, just wished they had air con/ ventilation in the pods.,We happy and enyoy leave in your hotel. Because your hotel verry good condition and location. Near MRT and bus station and supermarket, Gift markets, culiner. For the next if you can, please give us especialy price, hahahaha...thank you.  ,I'll definately will be back to this hostel 😄 it felt so comfortable, just like my own house with some new friends from other country, and I also enjoy my time in here, the place is near to the street market and MRT station, really great choice for me, first time to traveling solo in Singapore.","Boutique,Trendy",,,655,106,100
"Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium, an IHG hotel",4.0,"3,014 reviews",#116 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,I've stayed in good and bad hotels - unfortunately this is middle ground.  When booking in I was told my reservation information was incorrect - I was paying a flat rate of S$115.  When I got the bill it was exactly as my reservation information had explained - the S$115 dollars being the weekend rate and S$125 the week day rate.  Rooms are cleaned at 10:30 am, though you'll probably be woken by someone on the 27th floor long before then.  This is because the hotel is entirely hollow - the rooms are dotted around the outside with a central space where the lifts run.  Unfortunately the doors to the rooms are quite thin.  If you sneeze, you shouldn't doubt someone somewhere can hear you.  The rooms themselves are nicely furnished though my TV was badly tuned.  There are several, English channels - two of which seem to run off a video recorder.  The laundry service and dry cleaning service were exceptionly good and quick - I recieved my suit within six hours when I had asked for next day delivery.  The fittings in the hotel are definately getting worn.  My bathroom had cracks under the sink, the sink was pitted with marks, there was sellotape fixing some of the wallpaper & my lamp had a difficult time being switched on and off.  My remote was wrapped in plastic to hold in the batteries and the curtains were missing bits which let light in in the morning.  You cannot hear any street noise and the air conditioning is very quiet.  You can control both the temperature and the speed of the fans.  There are two pools with the hotel, one on the 27th floor for executive rooms only, and one on the 6th.  There is a self laundry service as well - the washing machines and dryers costing S$9 a go - the irons are free & there is a TV in the laundry room.  The 6th floor swiming pool is quite nice but small.  I didn't get a chance to try the gym which is opposite the outside pool.  There might have been a nice view from the pool, but it was very misty and or cloudy pretty much every day I stayed.  The hotel receptionists are very pleasant and helpful and the bar is exquistly expensive.  They run a shuttle bus to orchard road and chinatown every hour or so - this is free but I never tried it.  It was easier to catch the 64 bus from opposite the hotel and goto Doby Gahut station.  Get an ez-link card as soon as possible - the buses don't give change.  Otherwise there is no easily walkable metro for dragging your case to.  The airport organises a shuttle service for S$7 a head direct to your airport. ,…,We’ve just returned from a very enjoyable stay at the Atrium Hotel.  We grabbed some bargain airfares on Tiger Air out of Perth, so went for an extra long week-end (cheaper than flying East in Australia!)  I booked a King Deluxe non-smoking room via the hotels web site, and asked for a roll out bed for our daughter.  On arrival at 4am (we had paid for that night as didn't fancy sitting in the lobby at that time of the morning with no room available), we found there was no bed for our daughter made up in the room.  Too tired to complain we thought we'd deal with it when we got up again later that day.  To our surprise, our king bed was so big, we decided not to worry about the roll out bed as it would only clutter up the room.  The bed was a little hard at first, but we all found, it very comfortable once we got used to it. Plenty of pillows too as we found extra in the wardrobe.  The room was pretty typical of Asia.  Dark wood, and a little musty on the nose (soon got used to that too) Tea & coffee making facilities were available, and those little long life milks (we bought our own milk once out and about as the small ones were never enough).  Fridge was empty, which was great as you can stack it with what ever you like.  There was a list of mini bar drinks that are available if you wanted to buy it from the hotel.  Also, complimentary bottled water was re-stocked each day. (Singapore tap water is safe to drink - we did and we're still alive!)   There were bathrobes & slipper - if you're into that sort of thing.  Ours didn't get used at all except for our daughter playing dress-ups.  Bathroom was OK.  It was clean and well stocked with nice toiletries.  Shower in ours was over the bath.  It had great water pressure and an adjustable shower head (eg: jet stream)  View from our room was not towards the river.  We looked over the Furama Hotel, some parkland and highrise housing. (We were on the 17th floor)  Breakfast was served each morning, (between 6 and 10.30, I think) on the 4th floor.  The choice was very good.  The usual western foods like bacon, eggs, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, etc... Plus a nice selection of local foods, eg: rice, curry, noodles, etc.  There was also cereals, pastries, pancakes, a selection of breads, cheeses, cold meats, salads, fruit juices, yoghurts and more.   We left there very well fed each morning.  We only had to wait one morning for a table, and I think it was only for a few minutes. The hotel was full that week-end as there was some major Singapore horse race on.    The pool was on the 6th floor, next to the gym.  Pool area was relaxing after being out and about fighting the crowds.  There were only about 10 or so sun beds, so if you timed it bad, you missed out.  On saying that though, Singapore is not a place people go to lay by a pool, so it was never crowded.  Most people would arrive, have a dip and leave.  We didn't see any staff at the pool area, but I think there was a phone if you wanted to ring for food or drinks?  We took our own drinks when we went for a swim, and saw other's doing it too.  Whilst there it was my husbands birthday.  After a long day out we arrived back to our room to a lovely surprise of a bottle of wine, chocolates and fruit.  It was a very nice thought from the hotel.   One night we got in late from a day out, and none of us could be bothered heading out again for dinner.  We ordered room service.  Prices were expensive compared to what we'd been spending on the streets. (Chicken curry & rice S$15 + + +)   Food was tasty though.  Location wise, we had no complaints at all.  We've been to Singapore on a few occasions and stayed in various areas of the city.  We walked along the River & Clarke Quay one day and ended up at Raffles Landing.  It was a pleasant, if not warm wander.  Like other people have mentioned, taxis are so cheap, it's better to just grab one so you get from A to B with out getting too hot & sticky.   We used the MRT once.  You pay a price for your ticket, and then when you arrive at your destination, you put your ticket back into the machine for a refund.  Great idea as it saves on littering.  Close to the hotel there is a petrol station where you can buy drinks and other supplies.  Also, about 10 minutes walk up Zion Road; there is a Hawkers Centre (not sure if that's what the locals call them?)  Where there's a great selection of local foods at fantastic prices. Most dishes were around the five dollar mark or cheaper.  You can even get a large Tiger beer for S$5.00.  Just opposite that is a Shopping Mall called Great World City.  All in all, we found no fault at all with the hotel.  Staff members  were all very efficient and polite.  We even requested a late check out with no problems at all.  If you want a mid range hotel, and don’t fancy paying top dollar, you can’t go wrong with staying here. ,…,My family and I have just returned from 9 wonderful days in Singapore. We flew via Tiger Air from Darwin Australia and arrived in singapore approx 6.30am at the Changi Budget Terminal, which i can say i was very impressed with. Clean, efficient and well serviced. We hired a maxi cab from the airport to the hotel ($35S) where we were greeted by the friendly staff of the Holiday Inn Atrium. We had requested non smoking, adjoining rooms and an early check in which had been arranged. Our rooms were not available untill the normal 2pm check in time so we were allocated temporary rooms untill then. When our room became available our luggage was picked up and moved to our new rooms.  The adjoining rooms we recieved we neat, clean well presented and very comfortable. Our three children, aged 16, 13 & 9 settled into their room very quickly and with all their gear plus the additional bed ,a little rearranging was required but all fitted well. The beds, bathroom etc were all very clean and tidy, nothing to boast about but ideally suited to the family level travellers. The hotel itself and its staff were fantastic, buffet breakfast (which we paid for in the package) was great, the proof was in the pudding, the kids returned for seconds, thirds and forths every morning and all raved how nice the food was. My wife and I also could compliment the variety and quality of the breakfast platter. We spent two days by the pool whilst we were there and while the pool wasnt a resort pool, it was clean and very relaxing, the gymnasium was simple but had everything you need to work out (the shopping trips were enough of a workout for us). The location of the hotel whilst not in the main shopping areas or next to a MRT station was fine. We would grab a taxi to where we wanted to go and at best it cost us about $4S to get to almost any shopping area you want to go to. The elderly indian doorman was topclass. Getting us a taxi, giving advise on where to shop and where to eat, a great hit with the kids as well. I would have no hesitations in recommending this hotel to any family or couple travelling to singapore and will definately stay there again myself. ,…,My wife and I have just returned from Australia stopping off in Singapore for 4 nights on our way home.  We chanced our luck with Priceline and ended up with the Holiday Inn Atrium. As some may know, when you book through Priceline you are not guaranteed the best room, far from it on some occasions.  We arrived at the hotel fairly late in the evening and asked for a non smoking room fairly high up to enjoy the views.  The girl at reception could not have been more accomodating and gave us a room on the 19th floor.  The room itself was failrly large with a huge bed and fantastic air con. There was no noise as some have mentioned, despite there being a live trio of musicians in the bar until midnight.  We did not eat in the hotel as we wanted to sample as many of the eating, establishments as we could in Singapore.   The only fault, and a minor one at that is the location.  Singapore is not that big but it is very warm and humid so walking any distance can be a bit uncomfortable.  The answer to this is taxis which are always on hand outside the hotel.  They cost so little so we used them regularly. Final word on the staff at the hotel.  Each and every one of them  did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable.  They were all very helpful and always had a smile on their face.  On checking out we overheard an American businessman asking to see the manager.  This was not to complain but to compliment the staff. ,…,Here is the latest bit on the Holiday inn Atrium where we, my husband, our two year old son and me stayed from April 26-30, 2006. It was quite a comfortable stay for us. Having got a room on the 26th floor (of the 27 floors), the view was quite beautiful, especially when you open the curtains to see Singapore at night. The minute you give the hotel's address to the taxi drivers, you would be asked whether it is 'Old Glass hotel', or 'The concorde hotel' etc. That's because these were the old names of the current Atrium. The outside glass panels sporting a brown-black colour does look a little old, but the inside makes up for it with its beautiful trasparent lifts, which is even more beautiful in the night when it is fully lighted up. Although we had asked for a superior room, with king sized bed, one was not available when we arrived at the hotel. But they made arrangements for us to get our preferred room soon and in the meantime accomodated us into another room. The room sizes are small and compact, even in the executive suites, where we stayed.  The executive room comes with a mini bar/fridge, iron board and iron, and a safe. Service is quite quick and decent, whether it was food we ordered,  or the bell service or when we wanted an international three pin plug, one was provided within 5 minutes, of course a fee of Sg $ 5 was charged. Daily housekeeping replenishes sheets, towels and tea and coffee for use. Morning breakfast was  quite a standard affair, with a good mix of continental and Chinese. The shopping arcade on the ground floor takes care of all basic needs. If you want to try the reflexology foot massage that's available down in the shopping arcade, please take care to mention whether you would prefer hard or soft massage. (A note of caution: the hard masssage is quite painful, although in retrospect no visible damage is seen.:-)) All in all the hotel was a comfortable stay for us. No noise, no complaints, no problem. ,…","Family,City View",,,94,16,90

But I ready can’t acceptable is very very poor WiFi provided, have to use my own Mobil data until over usage!!!! Hello I’m staying here is 14days is not 1 or 2 days. Feedback and highlight several time also no use until I disappoint. ,We visited Singapore in early February 2020, in the early days of pandemic. In the afternoon we arrived Singapore declared orange status which meant getting uncontrolled & difficult to trace.  The airport was pretty cautious, yet not many people wearing masks. Chancellor Hotel complied to the rules they should register each guests historical travel: date & number of flight, seat number, last departure city, etc. Very good indeed.  The hotel itself is quite old. I believe it was very famous in the 80s-90s, observing its facility and strategic location (very close to Plaza Singapura). However many modern hotels in the same league were established in Singapore. So I guess not many foreigners chose this hotel, except for tourists who usually arrive with chartered buses.  Anyway, the, room was nice. The facility was working. Although as I said: almost all furnitures are quite old (bathroom, drawer, cabinet, door). But if you don’t mind all these, Chancellor is among the best in Orchard Road & very close to Dhoby Gout MRT station.,…,Room was ok, it was clean. But the breakfast i think they need to improve on it. Not much choices and the variety of food is really not that appetizing. So i stayed for one night, then transfer to another hotel (to try too).,We had an event nearby the hotel the next day hence we booked 4 rooms via OTA. Upon check in, FO asked if I just made the bookings as he could not find my bookings. Told him to check under the specific names. Check in took over 45mins for 4 rooms.  - rang the One Service number to request for 2 pairs of bedroom slippers at 5pm. They NEVER arrived... The female operator on the other line sound uninterested and reolied that she will have to check with housekeeping (forever?)  - shower stall overflows and wet the toilet area during shower  - nothing was mentioned about the pool closure, be it on OTA websites or upon check in. Such a let down when we were supposee to be on staycation  - staff in general are the ""legends""  who may have been in the hotel for ages  - no BASIC items, provided in the room: no coffee/tea satchet, no disposable toothbrush, bedroom slippers  To sum it off, NEVER stay in this hotel if you are looking for service or used to full serviced hotels.,…,The only positive thing about this hotel was the location.   Room and cleanliness meets the basic needs. The service was nowhere higher than average. I noticed that the staff at the reception were not even proactive enough to help me store my luggage and insisted on me waiting for the bellman/security who was then talking to another guest. After lingering around for a few minutes, she was then willing to assist me.   The worst was the breakfast. I understand that it is the Covid-19 season and that hotels are cutting costs but their breakfast spread is just depressing. The worst was that there were birds at the breakfast area. As the breakfast area was beside a garden, there were sparrows flying and can you imagine what kind of contamination it can bring?   After the breakfast on, the first night, I told the reception about this but birds were still flying around at the breakfast area. Pictures below for proof.   As a hotelier myself, I will never stay here ever again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a proper stay.    The management needs serious help.,…",Centrally Located,,,400,57,100
Perak Hotel,3.5,614 reviews,#156 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese","Share, ,value for money, very clean room and fresh bedlinens plus towels. Good enough breakfast.  Great to be so near Little India and also the shopping malls around.  Most importantly, staff are very helpful and friendly. ,When I booked this hotel online, the price quoted was 70 Sing dollars per night. When my card was charged, it morphed into 125 U.S. per night. At 70 Sing per night, one time ,I'll try it. But NEVER for 125 u.s. per night. The location is great. The hotel a bit of a dump. Torn  bedspread. No in room wi-fi. Too noisy to open windows. Breakfast is laughable. If they call a taxi for you, you have to pay a percentage of the meter as surcharge. Printing a boarding pass, one dollar. Could live with all of this if it was70 dollars per night.  I'm disputing charges now with Am-Ex. Lots of hotels in the area. Stay somewhere else.,We have just spent the best holiday ever in Singapore/Malaysia.  We left our Canadian friends in Malaysia and headed for Perak Hotel, Little India, where we stayed in a very clean and comfortable deluxe room for nearly 3 weeks.  The staff were marvellous with the daily demands and requirements of the many foreign travellers in and out of this busy, friendly hotel.  You only had to take the time to speak with the staff and they immediately responded. This family hotel is in an excellent location to get around Singapore easily whether walking, MRT, bus or taxi.  The continental breakfast was more than we, and the other foreign guests, expected.  Guests were provided with the ubiquitous continental breakfast - plus much more! The staff also prepared a local daily breakfast dish and, local coffee - plus many additional ""extras"".   Our Australian friends were immediately provided with Vegemite upon request.  We were able to have traditional Scottish porridge - although we thought the local ""porridge"" was much nicer.  Cheaper accommodation and backpacker dormitories are springing up in Little India, but they have no comparison to the friendly and charming Perak Hotel.  PS:  Excellent value for money.  ,…,If this 'hotel' was $100-/night cheaper, then perhaps my review would be kinder... BUT..... to be told at reception on arrival with great pride by staff that ..'you are lucky today as we are giving you an UPGRADE at no extra cost!'and then to be led up four flights of stairs to second floor and proudly ushered into a box ( ice box) that was our accommodation!!... Thankfully neither myself or my partner are overweight or we would have had problems navigating our way around the room and the cupboard where one washed( bathroom) The air conditioner was freezing at any setting and the bed covering was literally a threadbare blanket that provided the equivalent warmth of a huge TISSUE! Breakfast was ok.. The best thing about the OVERPRICED PERAK is it's opposite the mrt for a quick, getaway ! This is a backpackers pretending to be something better( the price!!!!) Way OVERPRICED!!!,…,Hmm. Chap 2 reviews ago got upset cos the hotel did not provide toothbrushes and toothpaste? When did that ever become standard - in any class of hotel. I am a westerner and  I didn't get welcome juice either, by the way. So what. Maybe they don't like Brits too!  This is a basic no frills hotel, about 10min easy walk from Little India MRT. That said, the room was clean, the bed comfy, air-con good and good hot shower. Free wi-fi too (my pal was charged S$30/day in the Novotel). But who is in Singapore to linger in their hotel room? Of course there were towels provided. But not toothpaste. Buffet brekkie pretty basic - toast, cornflakes, tea/coffee etc. - you get what you pay for. If you want something more substantial, there's plenty of Indian and Western cafes lining all the, surrounding streets. Efficient check in and check out. Pre-booked through Agoda so everything was in order.  Downstairs rooms have only a skylight, but the terrace is nicer to sit on if you want to watch streetlife.  You've got hotel 2 choices in Singapore. Expensive and luxurious/trendy places by the River or around Orchard Road, or places like this. I've tried the former, I prefer the latter. In the midst of Little India, the smells of curry, spices, every vegetable under the sun and flower garlands being made is superb. Its full of colour. The crazy bollywood music blares from many shops, and every other shop is a gold shop with the most amazing creations in the windows. Its alive from daybreak until late.

Four Chain View Hotel,3.0,66 reviews,#253 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese","Share, ,I read so many reviews and decided to stay at this hotel. The main reason because it close to Paya Lebar MRT station.  I stayed with my sister for 3 nights here. The hot water didn’t work properly and some part of the room need to be fix. But it didn’t bother us. We spent  It was my first visit to Singapore and glad I booked the right hotel. Easy to go to elsewhere!,I booked the Zen Rooms (Geylang),which I was told after checking in that Zen Rooms Geylang is a partner of Four Chain Hotel. I paid more than $40 to upgrade my room for 3 people, while I was expecting to be given a bigger room with an extra bed, I was given a rolled away bed, the room was small, has limited walking space with the additional bed. Luckily, the cleanliness of the room was satisfactory, hence, we decided not to pursue about the upgrade that I paid for . Other plus points were  the night was quiet and my family slept well, the staff at the counter was approachable. This is my first time booking Zen Rooms, the reality of the room was far from the photos posted in the Hotel.com website. I was somewhat disappointed with Zen Rooms, but I am still willing to give Zen, Rooms a second chance to see if other locations the same as Zen Rooms Geylang.,…,we stayed in a comfortable room and the staff were so friendly. They couldnt do enough for us. Nothing was too much trouble, even when we needed an extra room for my father when his ""hotel room"" was utterly disgusting elsewhere. They found an extra room so that he could stay with us.,I wouldn't really try to give a feedback or rate my experience based on the comfort of stay, size of rooms, modernity of the decor or the amenities inside or the noise factor but on some thing else. Considering the fact that this is Singapore and the area  surrounds the most happening of all night-life hangouts, which is Geylang; this property packs in quite a lot of punch. For me, its a) Proximity to MRT and 4 bus stops close by, b) 4 food courts which operate 24 hours and 365 days, c) 2 Gourmet restaurants d) 24 hours Fairprice Supermarket, which is 5-6 minutes walk from the Hotel, e) 7/11 Store just opposite to the hotel open 24 hours f) Efficient Customer Service Response from the Housekeeping and the Reception and e) Last but not the least, its a heritage hotel; preserved, in the true traditions of old Singapore architecture. It looks beautiful from outside with the classy windows and walls. If I were to compare hotels, which are similarly priced to Four Chain View Hotel, then those hotels would be rated like 2 stars only as I stayed in 2 of them. Or, did I forget to say that there are 3 night clubs right outside the doorsteps of the Hotel. So, try to get into the groove of what kind of a guest you would like to be and enjoy your stay here.,…,I first booked to stay at this hotel in their standard room in July 2018 and came back to stay with them in their Deluxe room in August 2018. It’s a small hotel and one that could easily be missed even though it’s situated along a row of shop houses on the main road. What it misses out in terms of the size, amenities and space that other well-named properties offer, it well-offers in in its strategic location. For instance, there’s a bus stop right in front of this hotel and the subway (the MRT) is around the corner from the left hand side of the hotel building. Taste and flavours of local food are also nearby and within walking distance. The Malay Village, the Haig Road and Geyland Serai Markets are those that should never be missed and are about a good 15 to 20 mins walk from, the hotel. Even the durian at Lorong 36 is easily accessible from here. The downside of the hotel, however, will have to be their rooms. They are small and some rooms have stained carpets and a rather bad smell which should be taken care of by management. Also, and rather unfortunately, some rooms are located along the shops on the side alley and tend to be noisy into the early mornings. The curtains on the railings could also be changed to be offer customers a dark room to sleep in. The toilets are basic and simple but working exhaust fans will be a good relief as would long shower curtains to ensure that water does not run out while showering. Notwithstanding, this hotel is economical in price and does its job to offer its weary customers some relief as the front office staff are very pleasant and always at hand to please the customers. They fixed the noisy air-conditioner and the shower curtains in my room when I told them when I went out for breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised to know that this has been fixed when I came back a few hours later. On the whole, I’ll recommend this hotel as I don’t mind coming back to it once again!,…",Budget,,,121,9,82
Hotel 81 Rochor,3.5,256 reviews,#200 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,If you are looking for a budget place to just crash after your Singapore tour, then this is the place. It is located in downtown area where shopping and sightseeing can be done at the same time. Rooms are clean, but don't expect much as this is not a luxury hotel. They provide liquid soap but if you're up to branded soap, 7/11 shop is just downstairs you can get it from there. The staffs are very lively and helpful. I will surely recommend this property.,We (2 couples) stayed 3 nights at Hotel 81 Rochor, small clean rooms, little bathroom with Hot/cold shower. Electric kettle and free instant coffee/tea provided. Good free Wi-Fi.  Recommendable as a place just for sleeping.  Very convenient located right opposite the road to SIm Lim Tower, for shopping of electronic instruments and components. Many Chinese and Indian food stalls nearby, western junk-food-chains 5 minutes walking distance near Bugis shopping street.  Receptionists Ms. Tricia and Mr. Celvin were very friendly and helpful, after asking for directions to the Merlion they printed out a route map for us. After a free 'late check-out' on departure day we could deposit our luggage in the hotel lobby and later in the afternoon Mr. Celvin went out to the main road to, fetch us a taxi to get the airport.,…,We are having good time for staying at hotel 81 rochor. The staffs were so helpfull and welcoming us so well. We were thankful for Tricia, Calvin and Gary for treating us so friendly. However, we totally disappointed with one of the staff's member (malaysian lady) which served us so bad during last 2 days we have stayed there. Unfortunately, we didn't know her name. She seems busy with herself and less responsible of guest's requests. She looked underestimated about what the guest's want. We will delighted to see her good improvement in the future, since we are often to come and stay in hotel 81 Rochor. Thank you,I booked a room in this hotel for 1 night assuming that it would be good enough since I am not planning to spend much time in a room. Also this hotel looked pretty okay as Hotel 81 is a huge hotel chain in Singapore. Hahaha, I found out how wrong I was as soon as I saw the reception. When seeing a standard room, I was appalled by the size of the room even when I wanted a bed to sleep on. There was ABSOLUTELY NO SPACE for the luggage. So I upgraded for delux which was slightly bigger than the previous one but not more than a usual standard room in a average 2~3 star hotels.  The room was so dirty and full of hair on the ground even after the cleaning. After requesting 2 times of cleaning service, the room had not been cleaned properly, still full of someone else's hair when I, arrived at 11pm!!!! I had to step out of the room for cleaning the room!!!  What is more, the hotel IS NOT an affordable business hotel for travellers. This is my conclusion after seeing a lot of construction workers and asian hookers paying for a few hours at the reception desk at night. This hotel is a FILTHY LOVE MOTEL which would shock you all.   It may be cheap but you can not move inside the room and the room is not clean at all.   Dont ever go to this hotel. There are still a few hotels which would satisfy you even if you want a bed for sleep. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT HOTEL! NOT THIS DISGUSTING LOVE MOTEL!!!,…,Very overpriced for basic hotel And website pics not same as room .

Hotel Clover The Arts,3.5,363 reviews,#155 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,This small hotel is a basic, friendly option very well located in Singapore, walking distance to almost everything. Rooms are very small and most don't come with windows, so if you're planning a longer stay than one or two nights, you really want to bear that in mind as it can be a little disorientating.  The hotel is close enough to the Raffles Place MRT Station to make it walkable, but buses also run outside the property door. It's a very short walk to the river front and both Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, so you're in the thick of the main tourist night spot hubs.   It's a small property on five floors and the rates reflect the cosiness and the basic approach, but rooms are modern and comfortable, if small. The smaller, windowless rooms have comfortable double beds, with, spotlessly clean linens, but there's not much room for two. There is a small closet for hanging clothes, but nowhere really to put luggage. There's a very small desk and an uncomfortable stool, but rooms come with WIFI, TV, a good range of electric outlets and a kettle with tea and coffee. There's also 2 x 500ml of water per day and free coke & 7UP in the small fridge.   The bathrooms are partly in the room itself. There's a toilet and a separate shower behind glass doors, with a small basin in the room. Hot water pressure is excellent, but cold water is non existent. 'Tepid' is as cold as you'll get. There's a very good supply of bathroom amenities and spotlessly clean, fluffy towels. Aircon is vital and when it's not on, the rooms very very, very hot, but the noise of it makes it hard to keep it on at night. Overall, the rooms are clean and well maintained.  Breakfast is served in the sister property which is a 2-3 minute walk out of the back, through an alley. It's of very poor quality and if it's not included in your rate, it may be best to skip. Plastic cheese, plastic ham, very poorly overcooked eggs and some basic fruit, with coffee drinks. There are a number of hot items, but they are all geared to Asian tastes. It's very disappointing what they offer. I asked for a banana and a yogurt and they looked at me as if I was mad. The cafe in the sister hotel is grubby for sure and the staff don't bother to clear the tables, let alone wipe them down between guests. A toilet opens straight into the cafe.  This is a perfectly OK, comfortable property with good rates in a great location. The lack of windows in many rooms can be an issue, so check the details of what you're booking. Otherwise, it works well.,…,We stayed for a week at this hotel in February 2015 during the Chinese New Year. The hotel is vey clean and the staff is very helpful. The rooms are small by Western standards. Many do not have any windows which did not bother us. They are all air conditioned. Unlike many boutique hotels in Singapore the rooms have separate shower rooms and toilets. Breakfast is included. Nothing special but adequate. The hotel is centrally located 5 minutes walk to Clarke Quay MRT station and close to riverwalk .,Was there on a business trip for 5 days. Staff were very nice and helpful. Since my flight landed early morning, I requested to check-in early (10am) but was told that there would be an extra charge of $50. After telling the receptionist that I was not aware of that, she proposed to keep my luggage and asked to come back at around noon. Breakfast is very good for the price you pay. Menu is different every day and you get stuff like toasts, (3 mains everyday, e.g lasagna, bread pudding, scrambled egg, pasta etc...) fruits, fruit juice, cereals and milk, coffee/tea, muffin/croissant. It's good enough believe me! I requested to have an iron and was given one within 15mins. I was also told that I could keep it until I check-out.   Room however is very small (you can clearly see how, small it is from the picture I uploaded. I had to do a Pano to get the room in full. I booked a room without window and it's smaller than what it looks like in the pictures. But well, toiletries were refilled everyday, room is very clean, bed is awesome!,…,I booked this hotel primarily because of the design concept and its relative newness. Traveling with my parents and two adult siblings, we booked an Executive Queen room and their lone Family Premier room.  We expected small rooms due to most of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised to see that we had enough room to move around without traffic. Perhaps it's because we booked the mid-priced rooms as opposed to the smaller ones.   Before going into detail about the rooms, let me discuss the location first. Located a stone's throw away from Boat Quay and a few minutes walk from Clark Quay, food options are unlimited. Convenience stores are within a couple of minutes walk, and getting to the hotel from the airport is easy as getting a $9/person seat from the airport shuttle. The, shuttle's stop is right across the street from the hotel. The Clarke   The Executive Queen room came with a Queen-sized bed, while the Family room had a Queen and a large Twin bed, that were set on a wood frame that's higher that usual (at least for most Southeast Asian ones I've seen) The mattress was firm and 6 pillows (4 full sized, 2 throws) were provided, along with a comforter. The linen was clean and crisp. A full range of toiletries, a safe, a small fridge, a flat screen TV, hair dryer, and a coffee maker. The Queen room also had bathrobes. The sink was just outside the bathroom, and a full-length mirror was set on the wall opposite of it, in addition to the mirror above it.   Complimentary bottles of water were provided, and was inside the fridge, as well as packets of tea, coffee, creamer and sugar. WiFi was strong and fast, and each room was provided with its own login ID and password. There is a limit to the number of connections that can be made for each room, but with my family having at least a couple of gadgets each (laptop, iPad, smartphones) that tried to connect, I'd say the limit is reasonable.  Breakfast was a mix of choices. There was always a type of eggs, Asian dishes, a salad, two types of bread, three types of cereal, two kinds of juice, milk, jams, and a cake. Served from 7:30 to 10:30 am, we opted to eat early, so space wasn't an issue. We were able to occupy two tables without feeling that we were taking space way from other guests.  Overall, this was a very good hotel that was great value for money. I would definitely recommend it and would stay here again.,…,We stayed as a couple for one night in this hotel. No more than a 5 minute walk to Clark Quay MRT stop (so convenient!) and within walking distance to Chinatown. The room was a bit cozy, but we don't need that much space anyways. The king size bed was one of the most comfortable we've ever been in! The complimentary mini bar was tasty after a night of traveling. Tea and coffee maker in the room as well. Flat screen TV (although we never turned it on). The art is beautiful and changes from room to room, and if you're really observant - you'll notice the story of a cat on the walls of each floor near the elevator banks. The breakfast was included; typical hotel breakfast buffet style: scrambled eggs, potatoes, potstickers, toast with jam, pastries, oranges, dry cereal, OJ, milk, and juice. Great value!,…","Modern,Centrally Located",8244,ZenHotels.com,712,111,100
Dream Lodge,5.0,221 reviews,#8 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,I am sorry to report that this is definetly the most overated hostel I have ever stayed in.  Pros: Sam the owner is a gentleman (it saddens me to rate it 1 star) Clean, nice pods and good couples pod idea.  Cons: how this location is fine with people is beyond me. It's simply on the outskirts and requires time and money on the MRT. Local area is ok ish for a day maybe. Takes about 10 minutes to walk each time. Fine, but when it's 30 degrees it's not so fine. Limited breakfast!!! Hope you like bread or cereal. Perhaps buy your own fruit juice too! It is also very very hot! The hottest hostel I have stayed in throughout SE Asia (2 months).  Also, we found the atmosphere to be very very quiet and bordering on sterile. Smallest common room I've ever seen. Furthermore, you get a big, pink band for access and a locker key.  Lots to keep hold of when travelling about, we lost it as I dont enjoy plastic/rubber on me when I am sweating and we are charged $10! They do have key cards but didn't offer it.  This is just my opinion so please feel free to see for yourselves. But I have travelled to over 120 countries and stayed in hundreds of hostels and this just didn't float my boat at all I am afraid. ,…,So, I did NOT stay there (too old for that backpackers environment), I was staying across the street and saw the laundry service sign. Went in and asked, all good, all yes, no problem.  Well, I should have known better... for 12,90 SDollars, you get your clothes thrown in a washing machine, then in a dryer, then in a bag, as a bundle. Result? Everything is wrinkled and not smelling very well.  I asked for 3 shirts to be hanged dry, cause they shrink in the dryer, you know. So those weren't dry 24h later... ok. But I was asked if I wanted to get them myself, in the laundry room...  The thing is, as the girl repeated tirelessly as I manifested my disappointment, they don't do folding. They just throw it all in a bag. Had she told me that when I first enquired about the service,, for that price, I would have looked for another service.  As I said, too old for that kind of careless service. ,…,Dream lodge provided me with excellent amenities a clean environment and excellent staff. The only issue i had with dream lodge was that it has now set my expectations for hostels unrealistically high :),The facilities were awesome and well-maintained. Friendly staff as well as a cozy kitchen and common area.  Venue was close to a number of food eateries & about 10 mins walk from the nearest MRT.  Faced a slight problem where a few of the wrist bands that allowed entry to the rooms were not working correctly, this was rectified almost immediately. Otherwise an enjoyable stay,Our plane was delayed for 45 minutes and the owner Sam was still waiting for our arrival. The hostel was really clean! When we arrived we were informed to remove our shoes or to put it on the shoe rack.  Then Sam gave us two towels and showed us how to use the electronic wristband to open the hostel door after hours and our shared room.  We were also given a key to locker and the locker was bigger than what we expected. There are still plenty of spaces after we put in two small cabin size luggages.   In the shared room, each guest has their own pod and there's also a pod for two people. The pod for two people will always be located above two single pods. The pod system makes it feel very private and secure.   Sam was very helpful in pointing us to the right places to eat food, and there are many places to eat from around the Dream Lodge area too.  The toilet and bathroom were really clean and there are hair-dryers available for daily use (yay!).   Fruits, bread & jam, instant coffee and cereals are available in the morning if you want to fuel up for the long day ahead.   One of my favourite activities here was sharing the TV to watch some movies together with other lodgers (hahaha).  We will definitely more than happy to book the Dream Lodge again the next time we visit Singapore.,…","Modern,Trendy",,,230,23,92

When we called to ask about it the man on the phone sounded angry and annoyed. And we didn’t even get our extra stuff until we called for a second time! This is not the kind of service I expect when paying to stay somewhere.,My 4 year old son got into a bowl of cereal that the receptionist said had to have come from there breakfast bar..... the same breakfast bar that has been closed for months now due to covid!! So obviously they are not cleaning and sanitizing the rooms as they should be!!! Air conditioner in rn 124 kept shutting off making it hot to sleep and fire alarm kept goin off for no reason. Managers response to fire alarm was to ""take it off the wall then"" absolute junk place!!!,This is hostel at the price of a hotel/Inn. It is in terrible condition. They cahrge you $1 for a towel that is not washed/clean. They state they have breakfast. All they have for breakfast is dry bread and hot water for tea. I would NOT recommend this property even for pets.,Clean and tidy rooms with good air conditioning. Sebastian, a very humble man at your service. Safe hostel for a family visit. Budget friendly. Healthy breakfast with fresh apples and bananas. Located on the main road of little India and very close to city square Mall .The hostel has a store with all the required food stuffs and other necessary things. Highly recommended:),I booked the Mitraa based on its reviews in a 4 bed room with private bathroom.  It may have been good once but seems like they have let standards fall which was a disappointment. Knowing its a hostel I wasnt expecting luxury but there were some simple things letting it down.  First the good: Great location, the breakfast of toast fruit and drinks was fine. The shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. There is aircon in the building and the rooms which is needed but I didnt really expect. The matresses were very thick and comfortable. The bits needed sorting: Thje bunk frames in our room were very tatty (which is fine) but they made so much noise everytime you turned over it kept waking us up. There were signs of mould on the room ceiling near the aircon and in the, bathroom. The bathroom had small moth type insects in it (they didnt bite). Finally the hostel is next to a pub, we were there Friday to Monday, every night we could hear the awful Karoke until about 2.30 in the morning. There is nothing the Mitraa can do about this but other visitors should be aware. Overall I would say there are better hostels to stay in than the Mitraa,…","Family,Budget",,,171,18,89
Orchard Grand Court Serviced Apartment,4.0,320 reviews,#126 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Indonesian, Malay","Share, ,I am very late posting this review. I stayed at Orchard Grand Court twice in a 6 week period in February of 2020. First for 10 days, then another 13 after a two week visit to Kuala Lumpur.  Good location, 5 – 10 minute to the MRT. Supermarket right around the corner as well as 7/11 and some reasonably priced restaurants just outside the door.   Staff are generally efficient and helpful with the exceptions I will note in this review.  Rooms are nicely appointed and modern, but the showers are VERY small and there is no shelf to put any of your amenities. I have never been in a hotel where there you had to put all your personal items on the floor of the shower.  I have two main issues with this hotel. Firstly, noise from the hallway. It’s constant. The hallways (and apartments), aren’t carpeted so noise travels. I could hear housekeeping knocking on doors every morning, “housekeeping”. My first stay was right next to the elevators and it was awful. The dinging of the elevator was incessant. The elevators don’t just ding on your floor. You hear every single floor. Upon checkout. I insisted to be put away from the elevator on my return visit. They indeed put me at the end of the hallway. It helped with the elevator, but not general noise. I will say this is not a ‘noisy’ guest hotel. It’s mostly doors closing, housekeeping etc.  Speaking of housekeeping that is my next issue. Perhaps it is isolated to my particular housekeeper as haven’t noticed other negative comments except one other (“the woman who cleaned my room didn’t know how to clean”). This was my experience. It was terrible.  Many days I found long black hairs on the floor. I have short hair. Sometimes they would be there when I arrived back after the room being cleaned (ridiculous), other times I would notice them later, clearly being tracked by me from other parts of the room.    TWICE the housekeeper had dirty sheets SPREAD OUT IN THE HALLWAY. This is shocking. I guess looking for stains that need to be dealt with, but this is just wrong.   Other times sheets piled in the hallway (photo attached – I only started taking photos my second week there). In my thirty years of staying in hotels I have never seen housekeeping pile linen on the floor.There’s a service area off the hallway and the door was open and there were several pillows without pillowcases on the floor. Also towels (see photo) were stacked on the floor.  One day the duvet cover had black marks and another day the sink clearly wasn’t well cleaned.  To get a pool towel, you must visit the housekeeping office down the hall which is a first for me. For a key to the lockers you must visit this same office. I asked for a key and it was handed to me without any key chain or or tag. Just a small key which is easily losable. Housekeeping said, “If you lose it, we will charge you.”.    I was going to address the dismal housekeeping  issues at checkout and perhaps ask the receptionist if I could speak to the duty manager, however my check out experience turned out to be the coldest, most unfriendly I’ve ever had in my life, so I didn’t even bother.  When I arrived for checkout (on my second visit), I smiled and said to the receptionist (Kosi, I believe) that I was checking out. No greeting at all, no smile, no words were spoken until she brought up my account and said, “$7.55 for the phone call”  She gave me my receipt and said “This is for you. Thank you”. That was it. Ten words the entire check out. No hello, how was your stay, did you enjoy your stay. Nothing.   I spent over three weeks in this hotel and I don’t feel they deserve my money again. I visit Singapore often, but there are many other choices.   I will say the two young doormen were pleasant, friendly and always greeted me.   Breakfast was OK for this class of hotel, staff were very efficient and friendly,…,We stayed for 14 days in floor 9th, our room was located near the elevator and we heard the beeps of opening and closing the door, otherwise everything was quiet. If you are sensitive to noise during your bedtime, ask them to give you a room as far as possible to elevator. The pool was clean and not crowded, also you can take your beer or any other food to have more fun. The breakfast is so simple and repetitive, but it covered every taste. The location is awesome, there are a lot of food shops in less than 1min, and a great Chinese/Indian food just in front of hotel's door.also you can find a ""fair price"" just besides of the hotel, you can buy any ingredients there and cook in your room. The room has the basic equipments for cooking.,we spend 7 nigths at this hotel, breakfast was ok , every day they try to put some different plate. no cheese and no vegtables  the room was spacious , hot water, clean and the best part with a complet kitchen and a wash and dryer machine. the pool little, but nice,This apartment complex is located one block from Somerset MRT station which is a main line for Singapore Zoo or City.  Easy to interchange to Downtown and Little India by changing at Newton (2 stops away). It’s also one and a half blocks to Orchard Rd, Orchard Gateway shopping centre and cinema complex. Small, well priced supermarket and pharmacy located underneath and a number of eateries across the road.    The only let down is the included buffet breakfast.  It’s very, very basic and falls below what would be a minimum standard for a hotel.    I had the one bedroom premier apartment and found it spacious and well equipped. Very clean with housekeeping during the week only.   This is a good option if you’re looking for something that has more space than a standard hotel room, and is under $300 per night ( as at March 2020).,…,Wife and I arrived early evening 21st Feb 2020 and received a warm welcome from the lovely young lady attending check in. We were given an appartment on the 10th.floor.The room was well furnished with plenty wardrobe space,full sized fridge,glass cooktop and Bosch oven/microwave.The bathroom was big enough with a rain showerhead and towels were changed everyday as was the bedding if required.Breakfast in the Crystal Cafe was more than sufficient with different selections each morning.Staff here were very friendly and once again always a friendly smile.We have stayed in a few different hotels in Singapore and to date I would have to rate this one at the top of my return list.","Quiet,Family",,,243,34,100

In hostel are Singapur maps available. I hope I will back soon  ,I live and breathe hostels.  During this trip to Singapore, I tried 4 different hostels and Beary Best at Chinatown was the beary best. Though, they do not provide breakfast like other hostels, Beary Best makes it up with it's quality, friendliness and overall ambience.  They have got you covered, A to Z (minus the breakfast B). Their laundry is not very expensive ($5 for a load to wash and $3 to dry), don't want to use the dry machine, dry it in the sun for free. Other hostels used to charge ~10 to 12 SGD for washing and laundry.  They have free coffee, milk and hot water 24/7.  Lockers provided by the hostel very spacious and could fit my entire 60L backpack. The bed matresses were of very high quality and so was the pillow and the comforter. I had good sleep on the beds. All , lower berth beds had curtains too, good for privacy and protection from the AC wind.  The hostel is located in the very accessible part of Chinatown and is at walking distances to Clarke Quay, Singaporean Parliament, Boat Quay, Gardens by the bay and all other party places in Singapore and the touristy spots. The bus stations is 20 metres away and the MRT stations is 50 metres away.  Very friendly and knowledgable staff. They know Singapore in and out and will guide you what to do not and not what to do. You can discuss anything with them - Singapore, How much stupid Donald Trump is, politics, economics and policies, food, transportation, anything.,…,The location was great, I could walk to all the main tourist sports and get food in China town. Staff were very nice too. They did clean regularly but I would say that they needed to pay more attention to detail under the beds and in corners of accumulated dust.

"Fraser Residence Orchard, Singapore",4.5,20 reviews,#198 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,,"Share, ,If you are looking for a place to spend maybe more than a weekend in Singapore, then look no further. Fraser Residence, conveniently close to Ion Orchard MRT, is a home away from home, with space inside to unwind and unpack your luggage, wash it and dry it, and even cook if you feel adventurous or you are missing the flavours from home. It caters to international clients spending maybe a couple of weeks in Singapore. They are friendly and the property is clean beyond belief - albeit there was a pigeon visiting the third floor elevator entrance consistently:) The property has two swimming pools, that can be reserved for ease of mind when it comes to Covid-19. The staff is friendly and helpful and can help you sort your things out in Singapore, suggesting transportations, shopping, venues, and the like. I will try to book here again the next time I will visit Singapore.,…,We love this property as cosy privacy and we enjoyed very much.The location is very good and not so crowded.The room is equiped with fridge,oven and washer with dryer.Full cutlery sets for 2 persons.Love the American Breakfast Set and unlimited coffee.,Great service. Difficult to beat their standards. Can feel their smile through the masks. Ready to help attitude. Great location. New property gives Fraser Residence a breath of fresh feeling. Their top asset are the people working there.,The One-Bedroom Deluxe Apartment was rather nicely appointed and had a cosy feel, but I had some issues with it wjicj eally marred the overall experience of the stay.  The most glaring issue was the poor ventilation system where the airflow of the air-conditioning got so uncomfortably low at times that it can get really stuffy in both the bedroom and the living room. Initially, we thought it might be an issue of poorly maintained filters, but examining them with a flashlight did not reveal that to be so - in fact, the filters were rather clean. Changing the room did not help so I guess it was the Daikin system.  The second issue was the poorly designed sink area with a draining tray in the tiny sink taking up a lot of space making washing difficult. In my second apartment, the, housekeeping also filled the dishwashing liquid with just water so we had to resort to using shower gel to wash our dishes.  The third issue was the location. This will be less problematic when Orchard Interchange on the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) opens in 2022 but before that, it is a rather long walk to the malls and good luck if it rains because the walk was completely unsheltered.  However, because each apartment is accessed through a semi-private lift lobby, we could park really close to the elevator. Despite the physical shortcomings of the place, I also have to say that the service from the guest relations officers was excellent.,…,I stayed in a one bedroom apartment.  It had everything I needed. Small kitchenette area, oven with grill/microwave function.  Very good washer / dryer. The bed was large and comfortable.  Bathroom large and clean.  Serviced everyday.

Fragrance Hotel - Viva,3.5,30 reviews,#254 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,English,"Share, ,I booked my stay from booking.com at $212.53. Upon arrival the staff told me that my room wasn't ready and i have to pay $250 over the counter instead. I told her i received the confirmation and was charged already, showed her the email but she insisted that she will call the booking side to tell them not to charge me. As i was already tired and wasn't feeling well, i didn't want to argue with her and paid the $250 over the counter. This is the first time i see this staff. I have been to this hotel many times and i never had problems booking from other websites like agoda or expedia etc. I felt cheated. If you could refund me the balance i still have the booking confirmation and bank transaction but i doubt so.,Husband and I stayed in the Superior room for 7 days, this was supposed to be a non-refundable booking if we cancelled out. Here are my observations; PROS: great location, polite cleaning staff - that's it!  CONS: Extremely overpriced for the kind of hotel this is - an ""hourly hotel"", which sitting in another country at the time of booking, we were totally unaware of and truly regret booking. 1) We booked this place on Booking.com and only provided our debit card number and expiry date, to our utter shock, a couple of hours later the entire amount was withdrawn from our bank without acknowledgement by the hotel. We contacted the hotel and Booking.com and requested immediate cancellation, both refused! Extremely unprofessional! How to trust a hotel that withdraws your money even, before you check-in, and our check-in was scheduled 48 hours later! We have stayed in many hotels before, and this is the first time we encountered this unprecedented and dubious situation! 2) The room was very tiny, with hardly any space to walk around or store luggage. The bathroom was spacious with 24hrs hot water. Towels, and a toothbrush set were provided. 3) Amenities in the room included an average spring mattress, not good for those with spinal problems, uncomfortable pillows, a TV that didn't work, hairdryer, electric kettle, bottled water and tea/coffee packets. No desk... no chair...the room was that tiny! 4) A window that was sealed shut ! So no access to fresh air, only stale cigarette-filled A.C. air - terrible ! 5) Room was only made up, and sheets were not changed on a daily basis. 6) I do not wish to be judgemental, but this is a place that let out ""rooms by the hour"", if you get my drift. On a personal note, I would never have chosen this establishment for a ""family"" because it was quite uncomfortable for us.  Therefore, I will not recommend this place for those hoping for a nice Singapore vacation or stay.   ,…,The hotel is located next to a church . It’s quiet and comfortable. There are not much crowds there . There is only a 7 eleven downstairs with a laksa eatery and Indian Muslim stall at main road . If u like a quiet hotel near to a park you can try here . Book direct via fragrance website will have more savings . I also suggest you to upgrade to their best deluxe executive room for a pampered enjoyment. Bring ur own toiletries as this is a Budget hotel so they provide very basic liquid soap and dental care only . The bed is just nice for my aching back and the pillows are comfortable and not too soft . You can take any bus outside main road and alight 2nd bus stop to eat at Seah Im Food Centre . Nice affordable hawker food . Or u can walk across the bridge to Harbourfront Centre, for nice restaurants . ,…,I checked in rather late and we were already very tired.   Smelly: The room is very very smelly with smoking odour, which I didnt know where did it come from. Either from ventilation system or someone smoke inside the room before us, or smoke next door, whatever, I was too tired to change the room and just there for few hours before we check out for other places.  Design: I got the last room in L1, which I need to go DOWN a short staircase to access to the room, which I dont really like this kinda design and feelings.  Room:  small room, but it has almost everything that you need, water boiler, hair blower, toiletries, etc. The room is exactly what seen from the photos during booking, and  I dunno who needs so many mirror a room for. one side of wall is full of tinted mirror,, and you have another real mirror for you to suit up. Which I dont really fancy mirror, really.  Meal: No breakfast, which we didnt need also, but got a 711 conveniently located just few steps away.  Location: In between Telok Blangah and Harbourfront, can walk from both stations or take a short bus trip from the MRT. Just behind Fragrance Hotel Royal.  Overall: Will not go back again as the price is not particularly low, location is not very convenient, and most importantly the smoking smell from dunno where which made me very uncomfortable.,…,Went there for short bussiness trip. The room was small and very small bathroom.  There were not so many amenities provided by the Hotel.  They have wifi access and we could do early check in with extra fee. The reception lady was nice and polite, not far from bus stop and 15 min walking to the MRT stations.",,,,87,16,69

But room is very small especially the bathroom. They don't allow early check in and let you enter only at 2pm. Quite stubborn staff.,Rooms are really very small. The washrooms are in the rooms. There is hardly any space in the washroom for taking bath. However, when compared with the location, it is fairly good. Easily accessible to the nearest metros and mustafa center.,Pictures looked good on Agoda. Booked in for 2 nights. Window did not shut and noisy outside. Smelly room. Mould and flaky paint. Sink leaked under neath badly. Everything about the roomwas bad. Guy on reception not interested. Told him we were checking out as could not stay here, he said ""ok"", ""no refund"". Made our skin crawl. Cheap, but they could  not pay us to stay there.,Stayed here for two nights because my husband booked this hotel wrongly, ac works noisily,very thin wall so you can hear EVERYTHING,bad surroundings (at night many drunken people) ,the room was so small and it smell like used condom,the toilet was the worst part,smell so bad and when someone did number 2 in the bathroom you can smell it when youre sitting on the bed.. Avoid this hotel at any cost! Oh the hotel service is also awful.,This is the second time I visit this hotel. The picture provided by Agoda is different from the real. Do not hope too much here. I could say that this is the worst hotel in the world. In the toilet, you could see the lamp cable detaches from the deck. On the bed you could also see a lot of stain and smell of condoms. Television is broken. If you bring big luggage, you yourself need to carry it to the second floor and there is no help from room boy because there is no such a service there. Receptionist is impolite and you should be patient man if visiting there. Not recommended.",,,,284,49,100
The Hive Singapore Hostel,4.0,428 reviews,#40 of 372 Speciality lodging in Singapore,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),"English, Chinese, Malay","Share, ,We stayed for 2 nights here but wish we had made it just the one. Everything was nice enough, the showers were warm but there was no ventilation in there so I felt sweaty again as soon as I was done showering and trying to dry off. Beds I found very uncomfortable but my partner said they were ok. We stayed in a double pod and it was just a glorified bunk bed with a little more privacy. The door to the pod didnt lock and there were buttons for things like TV but they were non existent. There was a locker but not big enough to fit travelling rucksacks. Could have done with a few more hooks, 4 hooks for a room that could house 6 people wasnt enough. Air con was good in the room though.  Breakfast was self service, bread and spreads for toast, and little egg fryers and juice not, much else.   Staff helped us with purchasing discounted tickets for attractions we wanted to see - Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Skydeck and Adventure Cove waterpark.   Location wise was its downfall for us. It's near Boon keng MRT line which meant we had a good hour or so trip to get places. We eventually moved to a hostel closer and cheaper near Chinatown which was the same space pod style.  ,…,Very friendly and helpful staff, good location, very good price as well as some added extra but non necessary features such as free laundry during non peak hours, which I have never seen at any other hostel I've been to around the world. Many choices of rooms to stay in as well as single pods for those who prefer to be more isolated when sleeping. Multiple showers and toilets throughout the buildings are very convenient too. Close to little India where you can find cheap but very tasty foods, markets, malls and more, but just far away enough that you are not in the middle of it's chaos (still a walking distance).,The hostel is surrounded with few MRT station.Boon Keng Station and Farrer Park Station and a bit further away is Lavender Station,Rochor Station and Little India Station.There are shops,restaurants,a big market and lots of spas around the hostel also. In the hostel...there are lots of bathrooms and toilets and FREE laundry and dryer from 7pm-9am.The only free laundry i've seen so far in Singapore.Breakfast consider lovely with breads and variety of jams add up with fried eggs.Not to forget Orange and Syrup juice ,coffee and tea and everything is free. Staff on counter(she is a beautiful Filipino) only worked from 8am-10pm...after that no one will be there to entertain any of your needs. Overall the hostel got 4/5 points... ,I travelled Singapore with a friend of mine to attend a training program. Since we needed only a place to sleep as I was out of the hotel in the daytime, we selected the HIVE hostel. Although it has pods, all were sold out and we selected a bunk bed.  From the initial point the experience was great. A trip from the airport to the place in a Grab taxi is around 20SGD and the MRT is available in a walking distance of about 800 meters. The beds were comfortable enough for the money we paid and considering the fact that we just needed a place to crash at night. Having said that, if you need a lot of room and space, if you expect luxury, if you can't cooperate with other people by sharing the space, this might not be the place for you. The shared facilities were well maintained and, clean enough with hot water (not consistently hot though which was ok for me). The common room was big enough and the breakfast was pleasant including serial, bread, eggs.  Only once I saw a cockroach in a room.  To sum up, it is a very well deserved place for the money that you pay.,…,I booked a Space Pod for myself and was very pleased with the condition of the space pod. The bedsheet, the pillow and blanket was clean. No weird smell and I also got a clean towel. The room itself was very clean, and they also provide slippers for us to use during shower (Yes this place have hot shower!). Although it's a shared bathroom, fret not, it is very clean. Breakfast is provided but you have to cook your own breakfast. Got eggs, bread, salt & pepper, jams, etc. The location is very good. it is near to two MRT station (Boon Keng (North East Line/Purple Line) and Bendemeer (Downtown Line/Blue Line). I am going to stay here again for my next trip and I highly recommend this place for a short stay.",Budget,,,76,15,86

We enjoyed out and out Let everyone make my trip.,Nice clean hotel in a quite neighborhood, within a walking distance to SMRT - Kembangan station, so it's convenient to reach from and to changi airport by MRT. there are several hawker nearby, and one is just at the hotel next door. The room is not big, but clean and tidy with basic amenity, and slippers on request.,Staff is rather nice. There is refrigerator. That's all about the good things. This hotel STINKS. Seriously, stinks, something very bad is in the air - I am pretty sure there is a fungus in ventilation. I am allergic and I was feeling VERY bad the whole 9 hours I had to spend there. Ventilation and fire alarm were extremely dirty, dusty and mouldy. Room was generally clean, but air was poisoned and you could see and smell how dirty the ventilation was. It was not cheap, I don't recommend this place.,Wanted a hotel close to airport to rest before next flight. Hotel 81 was close to airport, very reasonably priced and good value for money. Pleasant and helpful staff, room very clean, comfortable bed, toothbrush and soap/shampoo provided and a trolley at end of corridor with fresh towels.Jug with tea/coffee sachets provided + 1 x bottle water.

Ibis Styles Singapore on Macpherson,3.5,754 reviews,#184 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking on-site,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Hindi","Share, ,The hotel does not have properly trained staff. Despite giving feedback to various hotel staff when I called them, it fell on deaf ears. The worst is when one or two of the staff even laughed at my description of the events. The room was not clean. There was visible dust on the window ledge and leftover rice grains and bits of noodles on the floor. When I requested for items such as a hairdryer, bedroom slippers, shower cap, and extra pillows in the one instance, these were delivered to our room after several trips and calls. The calls made to the reception was often unanswered and I could reach them only after many attempts. There were times when I couldn’t even call through. I was told and I do understand that there are staff constraints but if they cannot get a request right,, it adds to the inefficiency as they end up having to make several trips. The food provided on a daily basis was not a balanced diet. It was unhealthy with many fried options, and extremely salty. There was also no provision of fruit. On one occasion, we were provided with one small apple which did not look fresh as it had a hole in for the two persons staying here. There was also no bottled water. There was a kettle and a jug. Thankfully in Singapore, we have clean water safe for drinking straight out of the tap. Caution - those going to quarantine here. Bring your cleaning supplies – I brought my magic clean wet floor wipes, general cleaning wipes and sanitiser. You will need it along with PATIENCE.,…,My team and I came down for deployment at Ibis Style Macpherson and the receptionist - Sandy, her team and a group of securities cooperated, communicated and treated us well throughout the whole ops. They’re all so pleasant to work with. Thank you for the chilled drinks as well!,I was sent to serve my quarantine order (QO) here and received a call at 11pm on 5 May that my QO has ended and I was allowed to check out. However, as it was late at night I requested to check out the next day and the staff asked what time I would like to check out as well as forward to their manager my SMS from MOH indicating that my QO has ended.   Next morning rolls around and there's no news of my check out. I called the front desk and a staff name Serene picked up. I informed her of my situation and she kept asking me if I had done my swab. I explained to her that I have already been cleared as I received the MOH SMS but she insisted that only people who have done swabs the day before can check out. I then told her that I was actually cleared to check out yesterday and she, tried to push the responsibility to me by saying that I should have called to arrange yesterday and even said that I should have asked for the staff's name!  Firstly, as a person under quarantine, how am I supposed to know what your check out protocol is? Secondly, since your staff already asked what time I would like to check out, naturally one would assume that the check out has already been arranged. It shows very poor communication that such things were not properly handed over. I do understand that with the current situation  that manpower is short but I felt that she could have been more helpful instead of pushing the blame to me.,…,I was forced to quarantine here. I cannot leave by law. The bed has human waste stains on it and the management refuse to even respond to my complaint. Aside from being utterly disgusting, it is also a terrible health risk.,Staying in this hotel under mandatory quarantine for 14 days.   Not a choice for us. WIFI speed sucks!

Location was good for walking access to Little India and walking to the underground at Bugis. or Little India Good restaurants within walking distance. The horrible things were the Shower was mouldy in the cracks between the tiles, The Shower floor towels were dirty see photos. I was there for three nights and the sheets were not changed during my stay. The room cleaning on day 2 was only done at 17.45 after I reported the no cleaning to reception. Not a place to stay despite its cheaper price.  Its an old place thinking New Bath Towels on your first night will fool you. The second day the towels reverted to very old limp, ones. There were no blackout curtains as there were no windows but I did expect that and was not bothered.,…,I have good experience stay in this hotel. Overall of facility and service are good but my mother found rust in kettle, shower head are broken. I also booking 2 room and request that we want 2 room next to each other but instead one room locate on 2nd floor and one room locate on 3rd floor.  Ps. Lobby locate on 5th floor and you have to deposit 100 SGD for key card.,On our first night in Singapore, we were surprised that our driver stopped in a seemingly quiet street. There was a sign that said QLoft Hotels, but there was no reception. A lift was the only item that was greeting us. Our driver had to explain to us that that was our hotel. You have to go to the 5th floor to reach the reception.  Bathrooms were spacious for Singapore standard, and rooms were always cleaned. Rooms look bigger in person, although the beds are comfy.  ALthough they did provide bottled water, there water dispenser was not refilled for three days. My boyfriend's mother had to do some prayers on our first night since she could feel paranormal energy for the hotel.,This is a last minute booking. We stayed here for 4 nights, the place was easy to locate just a few walks from Little India station. Situated in a quiet location. You have to request to clean up your room , enough space for the medium size luggages. But as what the previous guest have mentioned , beddings and towels are not that clean, and looks like they don't  replace the comforter as stains are still visible and hairs are on the floor. I had my allergy attacked during our stay because the room is dusty.  This is just a place to sleep nothing else. TV channels are limited and locked . Budget inn so don't expect too much. .,I commend one of their staff who is friendly and approachable. Sadly, I forgot to got her name. I think she is an Indian. She was on duty when we had our late check in last March 17 and early check-out last March 20, 2019. The place is very quiet and suited for the traveler family.  However, you have to borrow an adaptor or buy outside to charge your cellphone and watch TV. t was not provided during your stay. The wifi was also quite slow. I was not able to open and check my e-mail due to connectivity. ISome other was also not as accommodating like the one who assists us in check-in and check-out.

Royal Plaza on Scotts,4.5,"5,451 reviews",#98 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese","Share, ,Just tried to drop some frozen food and a microwave to someone doing their SHN there to be told there was a rule that nothing could be sent to the rooms to heat up food! How ridiculous and backward is that? Swisshotel allowed it and many of the hotels actually rent out microwaves to their SHN guests. No reasoning was given just a blank stare and repeated that it’s not allowed. Given that the food is pretty appalling  and usually cold by the time it reaches the room it’s crazy. The least they could do is allow microwaves. I will never voluntarily patronise this hotel. ,We stayed here for SHN dictated by the authorities. I felt like a prisoner from the minute I arrived at the airport and it has not changed from that day.  Check-In - incredibly rude and very unhelpful but suitable staff for this appalling standard of hotel  Food - 80% was inedible and we lived on delivered food from outside. I created a blog for evidence.  Towels service only when you asked and same with bedlinen and we had to change ourselves  We paid nearly 3,000 SGD to be treated like someone at Changi Prison, except in prison they get exercise - here we got nothing.,We were assigned here for SHN. Got off to a bad start when our bus had to wait 1 hour 20 mins outside the hotel for some reason. Not what you want after a 14 hour flight etc. We were never told we had to wait or why, and it took a lot of comparing for 1 person to even use a toilet. This was 3rd world service. Check in was prompt but, on arrival to our room discovered only 1 bedside table as the 2nd had to be placed outside our door to receive food etc. 2 weeks without a phone/book etc beside our bed wasn’t acceptable so I moved the second table back inside and let the hotel sort it out. Room was spacious and clean but the window looked straight into a migrant workers bathroom so curtains were drawn all the time. Food was hit and miss. I recognise that cooking for so many, nationalities is not easy though, but who eats tuna Mayo sandwiches for breakfast. Timing of food was all over the place and regularly arrived 30+ minutes before the stated times, eg dinner served at 530pm, making it difficult to plan work calls. Food was mostly lukewarm. General service for ad Hoc requests and takeaway deliveries was very fast indeed. No plates, glasses, cutlery provided except plastic so we had our own delivered from home.,…,I came back from jakarta and had to serve my shn at royal plaza on scotts, I stayed there for 2 weeks. My mom packed some frozen foods, we thought my wife could go there and fetch the food through the hotel concierge, little did we know that nothing can go out from the hotel (except for medicine) but everything can come in, so if you bring  any medicine you can pass it to your family or friends through the hotel concierge (medicine can, cooked and frozen food can’t, really weird)  I tried to talk to them, but one of the lady at the reception was giving me sour face and talked in an impolite way, she was rather looked annoyed with me (what a professional hotel staff huh?)  GOk so I called and even emailed the GM (general manager) , unfortunately he didn’t reply, but the front, office manager did. She explained that it’s the rule from government that we have to follow and etc. Ok I understand that we must obey government’s rule but at least the hotel could do something to help me keep the food frozen or chilled. At first when I called, They said they don’t have a freezer or even chiller (can you believe that a hotel doesn’t even have a single freezer or chiller??) my second attempt was emailing them, GM didn’t reply, front office manager did , they suggested i give them the chiller box and they will provide the ice packs, that’s the only thing they could do for my husband. So my wife ran to the nearest decathlon store and buy the chiller box and pass it through the hotel concierge.  During the first day they gave me ice packs quite a lot. The second day they gave very little amount of ice cubes I had to call a few times to ask, and the same thing for third day it took so long for them to give the ice to the room and once they did they only gave so little.  I emailed them again and asked if we could put the food inside the chiller or freezer and they haven’t reply up till now ( I checked out yesterday) it’s been 2 weeks and haven’t heard anything from them.   At the end, I had to throw all of the food because it was spoiled… i’m so sorry for my mom who cooked the food , her efforts and everything.   One more thing, I asked for more water (they give 1.5 litres of water every evening) but it was not enough I drink plenty of water each day, so I asked for more, the hotel said they have to charge me for a bottle of water. I stayed there not for free, I paid $2000 for staying there, but they couldn’t even give just an extra bottle of water. Me, my wife and my son served our shn for 2 weeks last year at CARLTON HOTEL and they gave a splendid service, we asked 12 bottles of water each day (there were 3 of us) and they didn’t even hesitate to give more and didn’t charge us.

Because it's not fair time. We wait until 3 o'clock to check in. So long for my family to wait. For staff ,service and another else is good. Recommended for stay with family,Me and my mom stayed here when we visited Singapore for 4 days. It was an average hotel. It was a bit hard to find and we had to take a cab every time we had to go home. The cleanliness was also average. The receptionists though were very nice and helpful when we asked about directions.   There was a nearby restaurant which we frequented and ordered Bah Kuh Teh and a vending machine for soda and water just outside the hotel.   Overall, it was an average hotel which you could stay at if you just want to have a place to sleep at. ,The room is small. we requested for 2 single bed and they gave us 1 queen bed. the bathroom is dirty. we stayed there for 3 days and they didn't even clean/sweep the floor. the aircon is dripping water. the receptionist is helpful and polite. it is located in the red district of Singapore. Many Indian restaurants in the area, there is also thai restaurant and convenient stores nearby as the hotel doesn't offer food/room service.,As our taxi pulled up he said “you know this used to be the red light district right?” And on seeing the hotel and surrounding area this fact did not in anyway surprise us.   The front desk got our hopes up by saying they had upgraded us to a bigger room. He probably shouldn't have raised our expectations like that. We went up two floors to our room. The smell of cigarette smoke hang in the air. Couldn't be sure if that was current or from decades of smoking that had just stuck in to the fabric of the hotel.   The room itself was tiny (thanks for that upgrade) and big enough for a double bed and single bed, bathroom and small desk. The furniture was all chipped and stained. There were some very dubious looking stains on my headboard which I didn't inspect too closely or I, wouldn't have been able to sleep there. The bathroom suite was a 1970s sunflower yellow with dirty tiles and mould in the corners. The sheets on the bed were clean but stained.    This really is a very ""budget"" hotel. Don't expect the Ritz. Avoid if you can.,…,This non-smoking hotel is a 2.5 or maybe, I would give a 3 star establishment. Please don’t come here with high expectations, otherwise I promise you, that you’ll get really disappointed, I know I did. Well, I can’t blame myself, as my wife did the hotel booking. Overall, the hotel is OK, if you’re totally on a budget or wanting to do a quick stopover/a night stay. This hotel is purely basic, with no bell boy, morning breakfast, pool, gym etc.  The hotel is about 30min drive, to Changi airport. Furthermore, you might know that Geylang is a popular red light area, in Singapore. However, if you didn’t know this, you wouldn’t have guess, as the Geylang area is a nice, clean and decent place to be in. Friendly to families, and children.  The bad points The room size is small, around, 250sqft. The room had a funky smell to it, but do-able if you’re desperate, like me. Not so fragrance, after all. The TV channels were somewhat limited, but do-able if you’re desperate, like me. The bathroom amenities are somewhat limited, only the basics e.g. towel and soap. The noise from outside, can be heard from the room, e.g. car horns, cars passing by etc. The guest parking area, is somewhat limited, but do-able if you’re desperate, like me.  The good points The guess that stayed in the hotel, are decent, and well mannered, coming from various Asian countries. The hotel and the rooms are clean. The room’s air-conditioning system was alright. The staffs were sociable and well-mannered. The location of the hotel is good, walking distance to bus stop, plenty of restaurants etc. The room check-in and check-out proceed was fast. The free wifi Internet connection, was decently alright.  Will I return again? Never, unless either I’m desperate or my wife did the booking again.,…",Budget,4947,ZenHotels.com,56,6,76
Hotel 81 Selegie,3.0,210 reviews,#260 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Paid public parking nearby,"English, Chinese","Share, ,Very spacy family room for 4 person. If you are in a group consist 4 person better choose family room. Superior room very small. But for family room it very large room. And just a block to little india mrt and tekka mall.,The Hotel 81 chain seems to have started out as a bunch of sleazy short-time hotels. This one (and most others, I gather) still do that but it's discreet and plenty of budget-conscious travelers stay there. The chain also provides reasonably priced room (for Singapore) in other areas full of great places to eat and shop. My room was very small (though I've seen even smaller in Singapore) but clean, quiet, with a modern shower, a small desk, and fast wifi. The room would be a real squeeze for two people, and there's nowhere to put any luggage beyond a small bag. But for a good night sleep at this price (about US$70), this is good value.,The receptionists seem friendly when we checked in. The location is good, it is near 7 Eleven, plus a bus stop, and a few minute walk from Little India MRT Station. It is also convenient to have our Night Safari tour because one of the pick up/drop station is in The Verge, which is also near Selegie Road. Little India area is just in Serangoon Road, which is just on the other side of Selegie Road.  No chairs or lounge in the lobby for guests who will check in. It rained so hard in the afternoon so when we waited for the rain to stop we don't even have a place to sit.  We were given a room on the 7th floor when we checked in. The room was so small, even the bathroom has so little space. As we were about to go down to start our tour of the city, we found out the elevator was no, longer working. So we had to use the fire exit. 7 floors! After our tour, we came back by night and found out the elevator was still not working and even the receptionists don't know when it will be fixed! I don't want to climb the stairs every single day up to the 7th floor! So we asked the girl receptionist to give us another room. She was kind enough to give us a room in the ground floor with no extra charge. The room was slightly bigger than the 7th floor, but this time it has no window and it smells. But we'd rather have a smelly room than climb the stairs to the 7th floor just to have a small and cramped room. The ground floor room was convenient because it was easier to get in and out of the hotel without worries about the elevator. The downside, aside from the smell (which we eventually got immune of in the succeeding days), was the noise. You can hear the people coming in and out of the hotel, including TV, telephone and music from outside. But the (indian?) music we have been hearing actually lulled me to sleep. However, we had one disturbing night, when I realized that some couples use the hotel as some sort of a love motel. We heard moans and other noises. I had to drown the noise by surfing the internet and preoccupying myself with other things.  Meanwhile, wifi is free. You just have to log in the username and password every time you switch on and connect your device. There's a bottle of water and instant coffee everyday the room was cleaned so having a newly cleaned room and replaced towels every night we arrive made us feel a bit better after a tiring day of touring the city.  I can't say that I got my money's worth. But then again, Singapore is an expensive city. If you are not entirely on a tight budget, you should try other better hotels. If you are an on a tight budget and your main purpose is to tour the city the whole day and just use the hotel room mainly for rest in the night, then I guess it's not entirely a bad experience because you won't stay that long inside the hotel anyway.,…,We`ve stayed in this Hotel for two nights without sleep. OK the rooms are clean but very small. The mattresses are covered with a plastic film, thats hygienic but not comfortable to sleep. Now I know what the plastic-film is for. If you want to sleep in this hotel you need ear plugs, because of the noises from the other rooms. Many couples book this ""Hotel"" for just 2 hours to have fun. This fun ist very loud and the couples have an all-night party.,Insects all over the room, mold, noisy AC, no window in room costing over 100SGD a night and I am convinced  someone went through my luggagae. Manager wanted to show me surveillance footage, I don't  even care. Had to pay too much see if I can get some back  If you see my reviews I was happy in other hotl 81 rooms and never ever left a negative like this before. it really was a nightmare.

The Quay Hotel Singapore,3.5,96 reviews,#213 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Malay","Share, ,Quay hotel is great for those who seek a comfortable place to stay for the night out of their usual bed in Singapore. Located in the middle of CBD, this hotel is walking distance to the major nightlife in Singapore, even to the popular maxwell food centre. There's even a bus stop right in front of the hotel.   There's really no complains for this hotel given the rate. Room size is decent for solo or couple, excellent for backpackers.,I booked a Deluxe Double Room and was looking forward to it. However, I was shocked to see that my room was totally different from the pictures provided. I called the Front Office to clarify if it was the correct room type and explained that the room was not what I had booked as advertised. They replied that it was the same room type but different room configuration. I was not able to change to the room as advertised as they claimed to be fully booked. I booked the stay because I was satisfied with the room from the pictures provided by the hotel. I expect it to be the same however it was not worth my amount I paid. I am truly very disappointed in the lack in transparency in The Quay Hotel’s advertising.,The location of this hotel is perfect. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing about this place!  Usually a hotel room may have a couple of things wrong with it. But the rooms at this hotel are full of problems due to ongoing lack of mainenance.  We stayed in two adjacent rooms on the 3rd floor for just over two weeks.  The rooms are extremely dated and really depressive! Cracked door frames, stained carpets and mouldy washrooms were some of the highlights of the rooms. Everything in the rooms appeared to be worn out. Beds were firm and uncomfortable. Even the padding on the chairs had disappeared.   The internet service was a real joke. We kept on getting maximum concurrent connections error even when no one was connected to the internet! We had to use our phone data to, access the net.  Another joke was the TV. Out of the 12 or so channels listed, only 2-3 worked. The rest came up with a poor signal error. TV service didn't work at all in one of the rooms.  The safe didn't lock in one of the rooms. Reception was notified of the above but no action was taken.  The bar fridge didn't work in one of the rooms.  Some positive things about this hotel:  Location of this hotel is just perfect. It's close to everything. It's at a short walk to the MRT, restaurants and to some of the central attractions in Singapore.  Air conditioner worked in our rooms and that was a blessing.  The Indonesian cleaner lady on our floor was very nice. She tried her best to clean the rooms but obviously couldn't fix the stained carpets or address any of the other issues with the rooms.  We did notify the reception of the state of the rooms. They couldn't help us as apparently there were no other rooms available.  Overall, we found the rooms at this hotel to be well below average and disappointing. We survived by spending most of our time outside and only returning to the hotel to sleep.,…,We only stayed till 2am as the staff said my girlfriend is not legal but she is 18 this year and they did not let us finish our stay and ask us to choose whether to push back our booking to December and it’s 7 months from now or to checkout at 2am. And we got no choice but to checkout early didn’t really enjoy our stay there as they even called us by the telephone in the room and ask us to leave and we do not know where to go after that because it’s 2am and taxis are expensive.,My husband and I were supposed to stay at this hotel early in April with our other business partners. The pandemic hit in March and we had to cancel or move the dates. Our reservation was made through booking (reservation number: 3631437549) . Despite all our efforts to make changes vis booking, the hotel made a change but NOT through the booking.com. So our trip was moved to october. The situation with pandemic did not change and we had to move the dates again. Emailed and called the hotel numerous times. Never got a reply, never got to change the dates. Wasted so much money and effort. It was unneeded stress and  so disappointed at how you can be tricked and pretty much robbed by a decent hotel (we thought it was a decent hotel).

Days Hotel by Wyndham Singapore at Zhongshan Park,4.0,"2,867 reviews",#97 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, French, Chinese, Filipino","Share, ,Very convenient location with many food outlets to choose from, Travel North cross the canal to reach Toa Payoh Travel East along river to Whampo Hawker Centre Travel West for Theme Food ... Thai, Western, Chinese, etc. ,A nice, clean and friendly hotel in the commercial district.  This hotel is situated on the Balestier Heritage Trail.  It's a little way out of town, but the district has an interesting history and some great places to see.  The free hotel shuttle takes you to the nearby Noveno MRT station, for ease of access to downtown and the tourist sights in Singapore.  A safe area for a solo traveller. Close to markets and shops.,We stayed at the hotel over one weekend in April. This was our second time this year. The first time our stay was pleasant and uneventful.   However, this round, before we left for dinner, we requested at the front desk for housekeeping to replace our empty tissue box. When we came back to our room after dinner, we were surprised to find that the lights were switched on, and that a random blank card was inserted in the card holder. We then found that our entire laptop bag including our laptop was missing, and that the empty tissue box had not been replaced. Nothing else in the room had been taken.   We called the front desk to report this and shortly after, received a call saying that one of the staff had taken the bag, thinking that we had checked out. We found this really, strange as we had only checked in a few hours ago that afternoon, we definitely did not check out, and the room was not made up. They brought the bag back up to us, without explaining why someone had entered our room and removed our belongings. We thought of letting the matter rest since our laptop bag was returned to us. When we checked the laptop bag however, we realised that some cash in the bag was missing.   So we called the front desk to report this again, and this time a whole bunch of people including the duty manager who returned us the bag, another manager, and a security person came to our room to speak with us. They told us that the staff which they suspected was involved had gone off duty and assured us that they took the issue seriously, and would do an internal investigation as this had to do with the security of their hotel since someone entered our room even though we had not checked out. They left the security person with us who was supposed to take our statement. However, he looked as if he was unable to take down all the details we provided him with, and we had to keep repeating ourselves. This really made us question the quality of people the hotel hired.   They promised to provide us with an update after the weekend, provided their name cards and took down our contact details, but it has been nearly 2 months since our stay, and we have not received any news from the hotel. The small amount of money we lost was not our key concern. Our question was more about the security and service levels of the hotel. There was no reason why any staff should have entered our room and removed our belongings while we were out for 2 hours for dinner and had not checked out of the hotel. They are also taking a very long while to provide us with an update of the matter.   My verdict of the hotel is that I think for the amount we paid (which was their opening discounted rate), the room was comfortable, large enough, and clean. However, there are serious doubts about their security levels, and their ability to handle incidents such as theft. We are very unhappy that they have yet to contact us to provide us with an explanation on the matter, and we will never stay there again.,…,Absolutely poor hotel with staffs offering you the black face when they not willing to help. Parked in the parking.  Ask the lobby staff to get a coupon for the parking, she just gave me the flipboard with some vouchers attached to it.  There was a form so I guess I need to fill this out.  So I did and took 1 coupon. Guess what, drove out to exit area and a charm ""Ding"", deducted $8 from my cash card.  When back to the lobby and ask why, said you should have read the parking tag first, it said you need to take out the cash card.  Said you should have read so they won't refund me on it. I guess poor customer service is a norm, first agent didn't offer to explain parking procedure and second agent just don't want to help. Avoid it you would like customer service. OKAY, the room, was new back housekeeping was poor.  Missing some towels after the first night.  No mini bar items, lack of TV channels, extremely small rooms, and lots of black faces from the staffs. ,…,Stayed for 3 nights from 9 Apr - 11 Apr  Pros: - 5 min walk to a local semi-outdoor 24hr-food court (great yet cheap food) - fantastic alfresco restaurants / bars /courtyard right by the hotel - along a heritage trail - plenty of temples in the area - staff are friendly, switched on and professional (check in and out process was a breeze); pro-active in following up i.e. remember to clear your room safe? Where do you need to go from here? Can we get you a taxi?  - shuttle bus available  Cons: - (picking bones here really) not too close to the MRT station, though there is a shuttle bus service  Overall:  - very happy with the hotel, in particular the staff.  The buffet breakfast serves its purpose with a decent selection Chinese and Western food.  Would recommend to business, travelers and tourists alike,…","Modern,City View",,,56,6,82
Sandpiper Hotel,4.0,603 reviews,#120 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Street parking,"English, Hindi, Malay","Share, ,Worst Ever Hotel.... 3rd Class Hotel. I would have given zero if it's possible.... During Covid-19 Pandemic situation as well, they are showing money & business oriented point of view. In case of Pandemic as well, they are justifying that, it's non refundable booking. Additionally, they are not even extending the dates as well. Bizarre approach. Even, founders the so called ""Pandits"" are not replying regarding the issue... It's only money & business oriented hotel...... They don't understand the problem & feelings of their valued customers they don't value their customers at all.... Big Thumbs down.... I recommend not to visit this Hotel at all , rather visit some good 3* hotel which gives value to their customers...,Arrived at hotel - met by gentleman at reception who was wearing a mask. We explained that we had a booked. The man nodded but refused to talk and would only make gestures etc. After we had signed paperwork he still did not say anything. Just beckoned us to follow him and took us to the lift and again no communication from him. We went followed him to the room and he opened the door and handed us the key and left. Five mins later he rang the room telephone and told us the wifi password and just put the phone down. We had booked double room ensuite - the room was very very small with no window.  The bed was not double but three-quarter even then it just about fitted the width of the room. I could stand stretch my arms and touch both wall (see picture). The bathroom was even more, appalling. It was so small that the shower head was above the toilet bowl. So if you had shower then  you would have stand right next to toilet seat. There was no shower tray etc so whole of the tiny bathroom was “shower tray”.  Then we went to see the man at the reception to see if we could change to appropriate room as per our booking. He wanted to charge us ridiculous amount of additional money to change room. We were just disgusted with his attitude and the appalling room that we did not even stay the first night but booked and moved to another hotel which was very nice and reasonable price  and reception and staff were very professional. PLEASE ANYONE THINKING ABOUT BOOKING THE SANDPIPER HOTEL SINGAPORE - DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL.,…,I had book 2 room for 2 days in Sandpiper Hotel from March 21 to 24 . But due to corona virus all flights has been cancelled . I request hotel to refund money but hotel refused. Second option given by hotel for date change. but hotel demands money more than booking amount whatever we had paid to hotel. Later for date change refused. I personally recommend to all Indian nations not to book this hotel due to their worst policy specially during Corona Virus Pandemic worldwide   JASVINDER SINGH , INDIA,Hotel is in prime location surrounded by lot of Indian style restaurants and drinking joints. Rooms were just above average. But the receptionists were too rude and unhelpful.They never listen to your requests.,We were booked into this hotel for the last leg of my partner's 50th birthday holiday. We arrived on the 24 Feb to be ""greeted"" by the most ill-mannered receptionist imaginable. I was so taken aback by her rudeness I didn't even get her name, but suffice to say she should never be in a job that involves contact with customers.   That would have been a bad enough start, but the ""fun"" really started when we got to our room; it was filthy!  To cut a long story short, we stayed one night out of the four booked and moved to the nearby Hilton Garden Inn.  Neither if us are hotel snobs, but we expect the basics of courteousness and cleanliness, neither of which were demonstrated at the Sandpiper, Singapore.   ",,10553,ZenHotels.com,282,53,100
The Clan Hotel by Far East Hospitality,5.0,435 reviews,#2 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,Chinese,"Share, ,Great location and wonderful service.  Great location for food and drinks.  From local fare to quaint cafes to Michelin Star restaurants. A stone's throw from China Town and the CBD.  Well appointed rooms, with welcome packs and signature Chinese teas throughout the stay was a very nice touch.,It's our 2nd stay in The Clan Hotel. My fiance and I have always been very pleased with the service we receive from the staff. We recently had our pre wedding shoot at the hotel, the team was very accommodating to our request and rendered assistance to make our shoot a relaxed and enjoyable one. The team took customer service to another level, we received a handwritten wedding memento upon check out. Words can't express enough how happy and thankful we are. Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. We would definitely be back again!,Excellent service! The breakfast was excellent, even in room dining for dinner was perfect. We managed to change the dessert as it was not advisable for my pregnant wife to eat pineapples. My wife, daughter and I enjoyed the set meal for 2 in the comfort of our room. All the staffs were really friendly and we hardly get these kind of service in Singapore anymore. I’ll recommend the clan to my friends & of course we would go again.,Kenneth and his team at the Clan Hotel were utmost professionals in their service rendered to my wife and I. We booked the Clan with no prior knowledge of it, only that we liked the ID and the location of the hotel. As we booked it as part of our honeymoon, we were pleasantly surprised by the fantastic complimentary and wine given by the Clan. We loved the concept and how pampered we felt by the treatment from all the staff. Thank you Kenneth and your team for all the hospitality that you showed us!,Excellent room, well designed and comfy bed..the room just fantastic. And the location was great with so many eateries all round.   Gonna be back again to celebrate another occasion. Simply wonderful. =) ",,19674,Booking.com,847,102,100
The Warehouse Hotel,4.5,354 reviews,#42 of 369 hotels in Singapore,Free parking,"English, Chinese, Filipino, Hindi","Share, ,The Warehouse hotel retains it iconic heritage look and feel on the exterior, everything else about this boutique hotel is modern. Lots of black and industrial touches. There are two wings of rooms that branch off on either side of the chic lobby and bar area. We opted for a river view room and were lucky to have one with full length windows that did not have bars on them. We spent a lovely evening looking out at the river while sipping on cocktails offered by the hotel - even though it was complimentary there was no scrimping on the cocktail menu as some other places tend to. The hotel is quiet and though there’s a public footpath right outside the window, running along the river, it is not too noisy - the opposite side gets more human and bicycle traffic. The room is spacious, and the bed comfortable. The bathroom is sizeable with a full length bath. Only for couples cos there’s little privacy. The plus point, you get to watch tv while in the bath! We had breakfast at Po’s. It was pleasant but I did not see or taste anything that others seemed to rave about. Service is good. The biggest minus is the carpark. If you are planning a staycation- leave the car (and kids) at home. Sure, parking is free. But there are only 7 designated lots. Then get creative and hope no one dents your car or blocks you as they double and triple park! The pool is small and worth a miss. Better to pack your most comfy shoes and walk along the river, you can head all the way on foot to Merlion park or Marina Bay. The other direction will take you all the way to Alexandra and is quite scenic with little parks here & there. This route takes you past Zion Road food centre if you want good local fare. There’s also good Persian food walking in the other direction from the hotel (towards Marina Bay) on the opposite side of the river where all the bars & food joints are. For lunch or breakfast, take the Marina direction and walk to Chinatown for local fare or old fashioned dim sum at Red Lantern. The Warehouse is well situated if you like good food and don’t mind a little walking - as I do. I’d go back to the Warehouse only because of its service staff.,…,The stars of this hotel : Each staff who makes our stay so memorable, be those at front desk (Heidi and Deborah) and the entire team at Po Restaurant.   My husband and I are enjoying our 4-night staycation and we’ve been so blessed by the sincere friendliness of the staff whom we interact with. They are so thoughtful, attentive and welcoming that I am compelled to rave about them even before our stay is over.   The food at Po — kudos to the head chef who works so hard behind the scene — is finesse. Don’t be deceived by the idea that it’s our local fare. They aren’t. The culinary team has brought it up higher by many notches. So far, we’ve enjoyed 2 breakfasts and 2 dinners, and we’re still wowed each time.  The gems of Warehouse Hotel are truly the staff. The staycation, experience is not so much of the unique interior. The delight is very much enhanced by these stars of the hotel 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💎💎💎💎💎🌸,…,Check In – the lobby was suitably crowded even for a weekday 1:30pm but check in counter was empty and I was attended to immediately. Process was quick and I was bummed that there were no further upgrades as the property was full. But also pleasantly surprised that I was given a cute welcome drink token to redeem at the bar – I believe house wines and selected cocktails are on the list.  Room – Finally stepping into my Warehouse Sanctuary (24SqM) after an one hour wait was a nice respite. At first look, the room is dressed in similar industrial chic colors and feels much bigger than its advertised size.  A very comfortable king bed occupies the centre of this space, flanked by 2 low bedside tables with its own lighting controls. On one side is your on-house phone, and on the, other is a very fancy Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker.  The bathroom is sort of open concept and actually very spacious. The single sink comes with plenty of countertop space, the non-bidet toilet is as it should be, and the standing shower space has great water pressure  I do have to talk about the bathroom (non)door design – the sliding glass panel separating the bedroom space from this is see-through so the entire space is visible from the bedroom. You have blinds for use but the controls only allow for the blinds to be completely up or down. This means if you leave the blinds up by default, there is no privacy to do anything in the bathroom and everytime you want to go to the toilet, you have to activate the blinds and wait for them to come down completely before you do your stuff. Conversely, you can also choose to have the blinds down by default but will have to weave past the flaps in-and-out. And also timing the closing / opening of the sliding panel properly. Design is cute, that’s for sure, but I’m really not sure about the practicality of things.  Breakfast at Po was great - we ending up trying the Hearty English Breakfast, Selection of Cheese, Smoked Salmon from the Assorted Cold Cuts, and a fresh young coconut (yays). Coffee was great, and so was service.  I was happy that this was a redemption stay and with the breakfast top up, everything was fair value. Not so sure about paying cash premiums but happy to check this off my list! Definitely a pretty property to try though.   Complete review and pics on Satu Kosong Travel Blog,…,Where to start? We tried the Warehouse for a staycation and ended up returning for more staycations, birthday dinners, and cocktail celebrations. It's that amazing! The epitome of Singapore Cool, celebrating the historical heritage of the building; renovated to boutique hotel perfection. It's an all-in-one: you don't want to leave the hotel. The cocktail program is exceptional and the hotel lobby bar has that perfect cool chic chill vibe; our fave cocktails are Singapore Sazerac; BB King, and Open Sesame (my girlfriends enjoy Luck Be a Lady and Forbidden Fruit). You get 2 free drink tokens when you check in and you can order any drink (it's a refreshing change from hotels that give drink tokens that can only be used for watered down juice). The Po Restaurant is also exceptional;, the PO for 2 is a must; the rest of the dishes are purely elevated and reinvented Singapore fare (a symphony of flavours!). The Breakfast is divine: perfect Western Fare and Singapore Favourites. And here's the best part, it's not pretentious, unapproachable, the staff are warm and welcoming. The GM is a lovely gent; he's at the front desk checking in guests, serving guests in the lobby bar, in the restaurant serving guests. The Mixologists are passionate about their craft and enchanting with customers. The servers have perfected service (which is rare in Singapore). Overall, we shall continue returning, the PLACE ROCKS!!! (like all boutique hotels, the rooms can feel small, but they are perfectly designed for function; the beds super comfortable and the bathrooms spacious; and vaulted ceilings on the 2nd floor rooms give the feel of extra space). HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Warehouse Hotel 10-stars!,…,From the get go the service was the most courteous, attentive, obliging and personalised we had ever experienced. It was so nice to be served a glass of water whenever we found ourselves in the lobby waiting for a taxi pick-up, and I was each time offered a cushion for comfort (when they saw that i was expecting)- a very thoughtful touch. We had one dinner and two breakfasts at Po, and the service each time was fantastic (as was the food). Throughout our stay, we were so very well taken care of by Gavin and Selvam. The rest of the team was fantastic as well - from the receptionists to housekeeping - but Gavin and Selvam really made our stay at the hotel.","River View,Boutique",29526,ZenHotels.com,110,20,99
